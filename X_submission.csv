Paris je T'aime maybe is not  a perfect film, maybe it is unbalanced but it is a nice film that has something for everybody.Being directed from so many diferent directors  the only thing they have in common is Paris. Et comme toujours Paris seems to mean love.I was particularly attracted to the story directed by Wes Crave, which I find so classic and predictable that it only can be lovely. I am not sure if Wilde would have liked it but now I know that Mr Craven is a romantic at heart.The story Loin du 16eme with  Catalina Sandino is probably the most simple, heartbreaking and sad of all. Full of a simplicity I can only think as admirable.And finally  Margo Martindale in 14eme arrodissement is the one who can really make us feel as visiting Paris, because we all feel like  foreigners who know Paris in our broken French and strange attraction of a city  we all like because of movies.",0.75,1,12,3,16,0,0,993,180,1,0.05705128205128204,0.0,68.1,93.81,0.004522246704911996,0.1737767420530162,0.004524454796235041,0.27309537386608085,0.544081182579756,0.012084592145015106,0.0007545271629778672,1,,0.0,0.6,0.75,,long,

Give them a chance and they'll cut, splice, and dice DNA combos until they wind up with something that looks like Lady Gaga's meat costume--yet it can do your taxes.  And ethics?  Ethics schmethics.  We've got deadly diseases to cure!  Where's that test tube that had the ostrich bullion amino acids?  Over there, next to the cornish hen hamster.Thus we establish the premise of SPLICE, an out-of-control belly wobbler about a pair of geneticists who create first two globs of liver spot punching bags, then add human DNA to this mix and create. . .well, something between what you find in a bucket of KFC and what you slip a dollar bill to at the strip pole.  As we all know, the mutant is going to run amuck and cause massive carnage, and that our two scientists (Adrien Brody, who needs a meal, and Sarah Polley, who needs a valium) are going to face ethical and moral dilemmas that will challenge the foundation of whatever the nature of their relationship is.  Delphine Chaneac plays Dren, the creature, and when she's not sprouting wings or flicking a poison-tipped tail she's making noises akin to my accountant after a bottle of Wellers.  Sure turn-ons for Brody--that naughty scientist.We even come across a Brody clone in Brandon McGibbon, who plays Brody's brother, so SPLICE is actually Adrien Brody squared, which should be scary, but like everything else in this howler it's not.  I don't know why I give two stars to a horror movie I enjoyed so much it made me laugh all the way through; maybe it was the liver spot punching bags.  Call PETA.--D.

I like Anne Schedeen's characters of Mrs. Tanner as she acts upset a lot at the alien's antics which provides some conflict in the scripts. And she looks nice in a towel too.,0.25,3,23,4,10,0,0,355,71,1,0.17847222222222225,0.0,93.34,75.88,0.46807304392366883,0.01599576268616604,0.48420680807866806,0.015804624007825105,0.015919761303671925,0.0647887323943662,0.0007022471910112359,2,3.0,0.0,0.2,0.75,,medium,

I like horror movies, shows, and stories, and AHS kept me watching week after week. It's definitely a series to start at the begining, and try not to miss any episodes so you are not left in the dark. I can't say every episode was a homerun, but they were all well above average considering our reality littered tv landscape nowadays. The entire concept is not meant to go season after season, so be prepared for this storyline to be finished and a new cast and location is supposed to start season 2. I thought the actors/actresses all did fine jobs, with a few standout performances (Lange and Peters in particular). The show does end with some questions, but it reminds me more of short stories that leave enough of a thread open so that the reader can think of their own ideal way for the story to wrap up. The writers did a great job of answering most questions, and the series ends solidly enough that I wasn't left feeling cheated. I don't know that I would buy the whole season (not sure how many multiple viewings it would get), but it is at the very least worth renting and watching.",0.6,2,21,4,29,0,0,1178,216,1,0.16395506792058517,0.0,64.04,92.8,0.00287200028480075,0.002898021708102272,0.5941897996530988,0.0029083558366071664,0.39713182251739093,0.017826825127334467,0.0005089058524173028,1,,0.0,0.5,1.2,,long,

In  other words, he's a complicated character, and in the hands of Bogart, he's  well played and very compelling.  Ida Lupino gives another one of her  intense performances as the girl who loves him and who herself is in need  of a break.  Joan Leslie plays a teenage girl that Bogart helps out and  falls in love with.  Leslie seems like an unlikely choice for Bogart to  love.  She's too young and there isn't any chemistry between them at all.  But for me, that's about the only real flaw in this film.  Director Raoul  Walsh blends a lot of elements together:  gangsters, bank caper, chase  scenes, love story, and drama at a very human level.

In the first ninety seconds of the movie, an old man stumbles across a strange, white goo bubbling up out of a snow bank. Using old man logic, he eats a dollop of it, and finding it tasty, suggests to a friend that they mine it and sell it as food. Naturally. It turns out that The Stuff is both sentient and addictive, and The Stuff spreads as one of America's favorite snack foods.I'm tempted to say that the movie is a satire on the mindless consumerism of capitalist culture (especially as it was manifest in the mid-eighties when the movie was released). There's almost no doubt that this kind of morality was on the filmmaker's minds -- there's a lot of fun poked at commercials, and there are at least half a dozen scenes where characters discuss the evils of The Stuff with big, name brand ads (Marlboro, McDonald's, and Mobile gas stations) featured prominently in the fore- and background. Aha! People are too crazy about hoarding ""stuff"" the movie seems to be saying in a message that's about as subtle as clown shoes.The problem is that the plotting and story are so haphazard and chaotic that the satire is lost in sheer stupidity. The movie is more senselessly frenetic than a Prodigy music video played at double the speed. I'm pretty sure that the editor must have been on an heroic amount of coke, because the pacing and cohesion of the scenes is tissue thin. Characters appear out of nowhere. Events occur rapid fire with a sporadic sense of timing. Establishing shots are nearly nonexistent.The really weird thing is that there's very obviously the mood that this is all supposed to make sense. Our protagonist -- a business spy/saboteur named Moe (played by an actor who -- very literally -- uses the exact same facial expression to convey everything from lust, horror, anger, fear, and relief) -- makes wild, logical leaps in fractions of a second, and the audience is expected to understand intuitively his train of thought. Like a five year-old kid trying to explain the plot of a Harry Potter film, the film obviously knows in its own mind what it's going for, but its execution is not just spotty: it's blotchy. It's the narrative equivalent of a Pollock painting. There's no telling what events lead to what causes, nor the motivation behind anyone's actions. And that applies just as much to The Stuff itself. The whole film is truly baffling.So why four stars? Because it's freaking hilarious. If I thought for a second that this level of humor was intentional, this film would get five stars from me. And even though I'm a connoisseur of the B-, C-, and D-grade of MST3K style viewing material, I still rarely find a film that's as cheesily satisfying as this one. From the very first frame, when the old man inexplicably starts lapping up the strange white bubbling goo, you know this movie has no idea what it's doing, and the very fact that thousands of dollars and man hours were spent in bringing it to your screen makes it even sweeter than the eponymous dessert treat. The fact that it sincerely THINKS it's making sense -- and in a dark and insistent way -- makes its lunacy all the more poignant, adorable, and hilarious.If you're a hardcore horror enthusiast who brooks no substitutes, stay away. But if you have a sense of humor about the world today, and if you're looking for a goofy film to riff on with your friends, and ESPECIALLY if you're searching for a wild card film to play on a Halloween party eve with some soused compadres, you can't do much better than this misguided, eighties treatise on consumer culture and pasty-white after-dinner treats.",1.0,0,8,2,119,1,1,3639,640,1,0.0796875,0.0,65.46,120.21,0.0013622805593537322,0.0013572974153694538,0.001346627555560341,0.38651922234915437,0.6094145721205622,0.0021984061555372354,0.0002747252747252747,2,2.0,0.0441504,0.8333333333333334,0.0,4.0,long,

I also expected there not to be all the dialogue that there was, and more ghosts. After my first viewing, with my expectations lowered, I decided to wait a while to watch it a second time. I think it was a year before I actually bought the DVD (Not the Vista Series), and watched it again. And this time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for its depth, heart, and it's minimal -- yet effective -- scares. M. Night Shyamalan is a very creative and intelligent director, putting heart into his design. The use of the color red was a very unique touch. The main cast -- Haley Joel Osment (Cole), Bruce Willis (Malcolm), and Toni Collette (Lynn) -- were all superb. The relationships between Osment with both of the leads were great. Especially that of his and Collette (Cole's mother). Scenes with them were near tear-jerking at times.The Sixth Sense is an exceptionally scripted thriller / drama. Too bad it took me two viewings to realize that.

That's probably why I feel that the last year, while filled with its fair share of awesome fights, hasn't put out an event that really ""wowed"" me since UFC 116 and UFC 117.  That's why this event was such a warm welcome, containing both great prelims and an one of the best main cards I've witnessed in a long time.  While UFC 129 had the names to really shine this year this particular pay-per-view delivered on its fights and while containing enough star power to attract the masses.  In my opinion this is hands down card of the year.The first fight on the main card on paper was a strong contender for fight of the night when I first heard the announcement.  If you've followed Carlos Condit since his ride in WEC you know that he can put on one hell of a fight given the right opponent and his last few in the UFC have been some of my favorite.  Dong Hyun Kim was making a strong case for #1 contender being undefeated and on a 3 fight win streak.  The first round finish was absolutely spectacular and the winner of this fight went on to make a strong case for the championship.Next up was Tito Ortiz taking on Ryan Bader.  To quote Joe Rogan, love him or hate him Tito Ortiz puts butts in seats, maybe more so in this fight than any other recently.  He's lost his last three fights and Dana White had even publicly announced that if Ortiz lost this would be his last fight in the UFC so as you can imagine Ortiz had a lot riding on this fight.  Also going up against Bader, who had been on a tear since taking the Ultimate Fighter contract on season eight before fighting Jon Jones, was no easy fight.  Given the circumstances I have to admit I was skeptical on just how this would play out and what went down had my mouth drop.  It's a fight you need to see to believe.Dennis Siver against Matt Wiman was probably the only fight on the main card that didn't blow me away.  It's a three round decision that a lot of people may not agree with and it's a fight I'm interested in watching again if only to see that my own opinion will change.In the co-main event Chris Leben took on his hero, Wanderlei Silva.  Having heard the announcement for this fight months ago I can't tell you how excited I was.  Two men who absolutely love to brawl and give the fans a show would go toe-to-toe until one was knocked out.  And that is exactly what we got, with a stunning quick KO that signified one fighter's legitimate status among the elite at 185.  Sadly this fight had its fair share of being a double-edged sword and if you've seen it live you'll know what I mean, having been a huge fan of the fighter that lost.It was an interesting little secret among the hardcore fans that the lower weight divisions underneath 155 had some of the most spectacular fights you'll ever see.  So when I heard that UFC was absorbing the 135 and 145 weight divisions of the WEC I was really excited.  The 145 belt was contested at UFC 129 and now it was time to see 135 belt defended.  Dominick Cruz has proved to be an interesting puzzle for the bantamweight division utilizing odd movement and combinations that have thrown off a lot of fighters.  In the challenger, Urijah Faber, we had a fighter with a knack for the unique crazy stunts and it showed on paper to be one of the most promising fights in in this division's history.  Also, a little bit of a rivalry between these from their previous fight didn't hurt things either.  The fight itself reminded me a lot of the first Machida/Shogun fight and the Edgar/Maynard fight from New Years in that what happened was an extremely close fight.  Many said the winner dominated the fight but I didn't see that, I saw two fighters going all out for five rounds and in the end I think the right person won.  Definitely a classic to be watched again.Overall, I definitely recommend buying this event on DVD.  I haven't bought many of the past events on DVD, waiting until next year when the ""Best Of 2011"" comes out but this whole card had something for every fan of the UFC.",1.0,0,10,2,84,0,0,4201,782,1,0.19374679333012668,0.0,72.8,120.21,0.3496805670426348,0.001053984939333703,0.027164242104795677,0.001056475872462638,0.6210447300407731,0.00238038562247084,0.00023798191337458352,2,3.0,0.0,0.8571428571428571,0.0,,long,

Indra grabbed the pot and raced for the heavens as the demons pursued not far behind in an epic chase that lasted for twelve days. To the Gods one day is equal to one year. Thus was born the Pot Festival, the Kumbh Mela, celebrated every twelve years to commerate Indra's heroic deed.No one seems to know for sure exactly how long this festival has been celebrated. Some sources say the Kumbh Mela has an unbroken history going back to 200 B.C. while others push the date back as far as 500 B.C. Whatever the case one thing is certain, it's the longest running religious festival in history. The most recent addition of the festival occurred in 2001 and an estimated crowd of over 70 million pilgrims attended making this event the largest gathering of mankind in the history of the world!Considering the immense history and the staggering logistics involved in attempting to encapsulate the heart and soul of such an event into one film, the filmmakers certainly faced an absolutely mind-boggling task. Yet somehow, someway Maurizio Benazzo and Nick Day have accomplished the impossible with the release of their masterpiece, 'Short Cut to Nirvana!'There is so much going on in this film that it's difficult to decide where to begin and what to focus on. Witnessing such an incredible mass of humanity gathered in one place at one time is enough to take your breath away. However don't become too absorbed in the exotic landscape or you'll miss out on a wealth of wonderful information provided by the commentary and numerous interviews interspersed throughout, making this documentary as fascinating intellectually as it is spiritually and emotionally.Pure and simple, this is the best documentary on spirituality I have ever seen! There are no visible flaws in this production; cinematography, storyline and soundtrack all come together to provide the ultimate viewing experience of the Kumbh Mela. The only thing better would to actually be there.This is a film that demands repeat viewings to fully absorb and appreciate the immensity and profound impact of the Kumbh Mela. However in the final analysis you will discover that human words and emotions are inadequate in describing what is seen, heard and felt during this magnificent production so lovingly provided by Benazzo and Day. You will find yourself reduced to one simple statement to be echoed along with the vast multitude of devotees gathered along the banks of the Ganges for a ritual bathing, the highlight of the festival.

We bought it because he loves the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book. This disk did not disappoint, and all the stories were a big hit. Chicka Chicka is done as a musical video, with an added verse not in the book that is a great addition. The baby letters race up a coconut tree which eventually can't hold all of them (hence the 'boom boom'). The grown-up letters rush to the rescue and the little ones go home for the night, but mischievious little 'a' sneaks back out for a very cute ending.Rosie's Walk is my personal favorite. An unflappable chicken takes a walk, unaware of the unlucky fox who tries to sneak up on her. Great music and quite funny.The Caterpillar and the Pollywog is a great story, and the pollywog/frog is irristable in his enthusiasm.The Foolish Frog is a classic. Pete Seeger is a master storyteller, and the story is a lot of fun and hilarious.Joey Runs Away is very funny and sweet.

But they dressed very nice, seemed to be deeply religious people. and hard working. And i was amazed with their FORGIVNESS, by attending the funeral of the Murderer who slaughted five of their children. These people interest me, they lived in a very rural part of the country. Everything looked beautiful, and Especialy in FALL when the leaves on the trees were glowing in many beautiful colors. The Amish people looked healthy, due to them being Farmers had alot to do with it, with that healthy outdoor life. It certainly looked to be good air out that way. I think its somewhat of a pity as the children grow up, to leave the community for the bright lights, and a new life. As the number of Amish people will become less. This was a nice documentary of THE AMISH, showing us their way of life. The photography was excellent, we see the beautiful countryside where they lived, and all of their animals, they were mainly horses and cows. Although i thought the animals did it tough in the WINTER, they looked very bleak and lonely out there in the fields as it snowed. A cover would have helped protect them from the cold.

I found this film to be a candid glimpse into the tenacity of the union struggle as well as a highlight of decisions that impacted people's lives forever.Barbara Kopple did a wonderful job of interviewing union members who felt differently about the struggle going on.  Each year, while my class views the film, I wonder whatever happened to the two brothers she highlights in the film -- one who was pro-union, no matter what, and one who decided to cross the picket line to support his family.  In the film, the pro-union brother disowns his brother for becoming a scab.  I found that family squabble to be classic of the kind of destruction this long, drawn out union battle caused.This film represents the American Dream quite nicely.  Here you have hundreds and thousands of union members who are fighting for the American Dream, but whose vision becomes a little cloudy during the struggle.

The story is interesting, but its biggest asset is Bette Davis' rather subdued performance as Charlotte Lovell, the woman who pays the price. Made in 1939, the film is from Davis' golden period. She was nominated for an Academy Award every year from 1939 to 1943. While her work here is strong, she received no special acclaim for it, possibly because the role is so similar to the one she played in the superior ""Jezebel"", for which she won an Oscar in 1939.The movie begins during the Civil War. Socialite Delia Lovell [Miriam Hopkins] is about to be wed, and her cousin Charlotte is in attendance. When Delia learns that the man she promised to marry two years earlier is in town, she sends Charlotte to beg him not to make a scene. The guy is one Charlotte is secretly in love with, and she winds up consoling him in a very intimate fashion. Several years pass. The man has been killed in the war, and Charlotte is running a home for war orphans. When Delia learns that one of the children is actually one Charlotte had out of wedlock and that the father was the dead soldier, she destroys Charlotte's chance to marry a very prominent man. In a cruel twist of fate, Charlotte's daughter grows up in Delia's home and is led to believe that her mother is her aunt.Bette Davis was a rather unusual star for her time because she was also a consummate actress. As such, she demanded roles in which glamour and beauty were often cast aside. Stunningly pretty in the first part of the movie, she spends the rest of it heavily made up to look like a dowdy old maid aunt. It's a startling transformation. By contrast, her co-star, Ms. Hopkins, typical of female stars at the time, barely ages at all. Hopkins actually gives a sensitive, studied performance, but, because of her determination to portray her character as realistically as possible, Davis totally dominates the picture.The photography and the sets are first-rate. The script seems a little truncated, and I wonder if the print we have today is an edited one that the studio made for second run engagements. [This was a common practice in those days.] The score by Max Steiner is not one of his best and relies heavily on stock music, such as Old My Darling Clementine and Wagner's Wedding March. But when would he have had the time to compose one of his full, lush scores for the movie? He worked on at least a dozen movies that year. One of those was ""Gone With the Wind"".",0.8823529411764706,2,36,5,71,1,0,2603,471,1,0.05566511387163562,0.16666666666666666,70.73,49.48,0.002078744478799746,0.12290482511276164,0.0020676831001628453,0.870861310639233,0.0020874366690427897,0.013830195927775643,0.00033884521550555703,3,3.5,0.0048384,0.8333333333333334,1.7647058823529411,,long,

True, the concept itself might not be the most original, but this crowd-pleasing John Landis comedy skewers American race and class tensions in a way that is refreshingly original.Set in the City of Brotherly Love, ""Trading Places"" is filled with stand-out performances and witty dialogue.

Dan Aykroyd is adequate as Louis Winthop III, the callow stock broker whose life is ruined by the Dukes.  As for Ms. Jamie Lee Curtis...well?  If you don't think she pulls off one of the sexiest performances ever put on the screen, then it's your own fault.

I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  These tapes are fantastic.  Alan Finger is a great teacher and keeps you focused on breathing and correct form.  There are two women performing the poses and one of them shows the poses in a modified manner.  Alan is constantly describing modifications to do if you have a weak back, a weak neck, weak knees, etc.  He is also honest by telling you when a pose is very difficult and tells you only to go into the pose further if you can take a full breath.The first tape that I would suggest doing is the Introduction to Yoga tape.  You will learn very basic yoga poses and it is accessible to a beginner.  The other two tapes include some more difficult poses as well as building on the poses you learn in the introduction tape.  A meditation tape is also included which is great for calming your mind and body.Being a beginner, I was a little daunted by yoga.  BUT...this tape really makes you feel comfortable with the poses and allows you to progress at your own speed.  I have noticed a big difference since beginning to use these tapes.  My posture has improved and I sleep better at night.  I hurt my back in a car accident a couple of years ago and have found that yoga helps to eliminate my lower back pain.  You will be surprised by the number of muscles that yoga works.

I know - supply and demand ... why such an apparently modest demand?  Anyway ... to me Bellini's music is wonderful, as is this Decca DVD offering featuring Juan Diego Florez and Nino Machaidze.After becoming captivated by the Cedolins/Ganassi Norma of 2007 and by Eglise Gutierrez's Amina in La Sonnambula, and Bellini's music in general on various audio recordings, I was determined to add I Puritani to my collection.Thankfully, I was not persuaded to look elsewhere because of a few critical reviews concerning the soprano Ms. Machaidze.  I found nothing at all wrong with her stage presence and acting ... and vocally (while i am not an expert on perfect bel canto technique), her singing was more than satisfying :-)- A couple of weeks ago, only half kiddingly, I told my wife that I had found the most beautiful piece of music ever ... Natalie Dessay's version of Elvira's mad scene ""O rendetemi la speme ... Qui la voce sua soave ... Vien diletto"" from this opera's Act II - nearly 17 minutes of bliss.  So I was a little apprehensive as to how well it would sound on this performance because of the critical reviews.  Fear not - it is wonderful and beautiful, as is the rest of the performance.Together, Juan Diego Florez and Ms. Machaidze are perfectly complimentary.  In their duets, neither vocalist overpowers the other. Their reunion duet in the middle of Act III was outstanding and received a well deserved and spirited ovation of almost two minutes.The supporting cast was fine, and the chorus sounded good too.Visually, the minimalist staging was fine, and the costumes were attractive.  Personally, I find black, grey, and dark blue quite pleasing - and that is the predominant color scheme throughout the opera.  One reviewer took exception to the dark lighting ...  this only occurs in small segments here and there and must have been by design.  Most often though, the singers were sufficiently visible.  Overall, the video of this DVD is quite fine, as is the audio.  5 stars !!!

The same person gave Fantasia 2000 a ONE STAR RATING because it was just 'more of the same'.I have said this before in other reviews, and I will say it here: If you are the type of person who thinks the recently released movie 'Stealth' with Jaime Foxx is excellence in filmmaking, YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIKE EITHER FANTASIA (or any halfway intelligent movie, for that matter). Everyone has their own opinion, but anyone who calls the original Fantasia ""dumb"" makes me think they are the pot calling the kettle black (which isn't even a correct analogy, as Fantasia is most assuredly not 'dumb'). It just goes to show you, there are probably people out there who think the Beatles were completely uncreative and bad musicians. It takes all kinds....Which leads me to my point. I think an awful lot of people are being unfair to Fantasia 2000 by comparing it to the original. Fantasia 2000 is not a remake of the original, and its not supposed to top the original. If anything, it is a continuation of the CONCEPT. Don't judge it by the merits of the original, judge it on its own merits as a standalone project. If you do that, and don't expect a ""Fantasia"" part 2, you will be most impressed with Fantasia 2000.One of the beautiful things about Fantasia 2000 is that Disney tried to get as much variety in animation styling as possible. From the hand drawn centerpiece (and overall BEST Fantasia segment ever) Firebird Suite to the reminiscent-of-'70s-animation watercolored Canival Of The Animals to the computer generated Steadfast Tin Soldier, Fantasia 2000's segments are wildly different visually. Instead of making the segments seem disjointed though, the effect is to make each segment seem to be an experiment in art, and after all, isn't that what Walt intended Fantasia to be?The only real weakpoint of Fantasia 2000 is the inclusion of The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Not because it is a bad segment, but because it gives the film a 'retread' feel and an attachment to Fantasia that holds Fantasia 2000 in the impossible position of being compared to the original. Disney included the segment to achieve a continuity with the original, but they should have used all new segments and been happy to be judged as a freestanding project. Despite this misfire, Fantasia 2000 is a great movie. All the segments are entertaining and beautiful. Firebird Suite is particularly enchanting, and for those that want to make comparisons: since when is the ubiquitous theme of death and rebirth the sole domain of Night On Bald Mountain? Such comparisons do an injustice to both Fantasias.All in all, while it cannot match the original for groundbreaking techniques and jawdropping animation/effects, Fantasia 2000 is just as creative and entertaining as the original. If you enjoyed Fantasia, you should absolutely enjoy Fantasia 2000. Walt would be proud.",0.8571428571428571,1,83,13,82,2,0,2923,491,1,0.23584280303030306,0.1875,60.04,41.36,0.07785880550812588,0.001957546431537494,0.1720646206860656,0.0019567749819067396,0.7461622523923642,0.028395484091686622,0.000293140512018761,1,,0.0,0.75,0.8571428571428571,,long,

Mel Gibson plays Ben Martin, some one that is perfectly content with his life as it is and, will not fight in a war that will that not only destroy the lives of his countrymen, but could be witnessed by the eyes of his children. Soon, as the war starts to tear at his families bindings, He too finds himself wading into its bitter turmoils. After several viewings I see the strong likeness to Braveheart. Someone dies, he is enreged, takes revenge, then is off to war. I have been turning the question around and around in my head, why did they make the story line at such a close resemblance? Maybe, after five years, we needed it. Braveheart struck a chord in me when I saw it, and goodness know's I was proud to have Scottish blood in me, and still am. The Patriot should do something else, and that is: make us proud of our forefathers, and cheer for them. To understand, atleast to some extent, what our ancestors went through. We will never know how that felt. Now, even though we still have fighters and patriots, we will never know what it was like to fight a tyrant king that wants absolute control of our lives, and well being. We will never feel that. The Patriot does give a hint, a glimps, into the way it was. Maybe historically the facts about Francis Marion will never make a perfect appearance on the big screen, but this movie isn't about exactness. It's about our freedom, and the high cost of it; The love we did have for our country, and the reflection of devotion that we should have now. ~S.A.O.S.~",0.0,0,16,4,53,1,0,1610,299,1,0.29958333333333337,0.0,77.87,92.8,0.0033287681124112675,0.0033562007119390318,0.0033236206930006497,0.7008119802640081,0.2891794302186409,0.009937888198757764,0.0,3,4.5,0.0011232,0.0,0.0,4.5,long,

It  took me several hours to even speak- literally even speak- after seeing it  with friends of mine who bawled uncontrollably throught 90% of this epic.  It was days before I could even tell people that I saw it.I have seen  CITIZEN KANE; I have seen CASABLANCA; I have seen E.T.; ALL ABOUT EVE; THE  GODFATHER; APOCAPSYE NOW; Olivier's OTHELLO; IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE; and so  on, and so on... this is the greatest movie I have ever seen; bar none.  I  never knew the love a father has for his wife and son could be portrayed so  incredibly, in the context of prevailing against the ultimate evil and  madness.  It's European way of refusing to tell you how to feel, but  allowing you to witness the uncontrollable flood of your own emotions as  you bare witness to that which is most frightening and most beautiful in  being human just has to be seen to be understood- there are no superlatives  I can think of that could do it justice.This movie has changed me,  and changed the way I see the entire art form of cinema- its value to  society, and the possibility of its capacity to reveal truth.I have  not seen the dubbed version, and I would suggest to any who have not seen  this in the theatres to find the version with English subtitles.  Dubbbed  films, in sacrificing so much in the translation, tend to muffle the soul  of the actors' perfomance; to big a price to pay, I believe, for the  convenience of not having to look down and read while looking up and  experiencing this in its purest, most complete sense.As far as I am  concerned, this is the greatest movie ever made.",0.9166666666666666,1,53,10,46,0,0,1658,302,1,0.24017094017094015,1.0,62.82,95.17,0.08029934615059645,0.16823922963608257,0.0028906216276458063,0.44968414951759716,0.2988866530680781,0.031966224366706875,0.0005525416917821981,1,,0.0,0.8461538461538461,0.9166666666666666,5.0,long,

At this point De Niro was already a major star, having made his bones not only in Scorsese masterpieces like 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver' but also in Cimino's classic 'The Deer Hunter' and of course as the young Vito Corleone in 'The Godfather Part 2'. He already had at this point two Oscars under his belt, one for Best Supporting Actor ('The Godfather Part 2') and one for Best Leading Actor ('Raging Bull'), plus two more nominations. And it was at this point that Scorsese cast him in a bizarre and off-beat dark comedy alongside slapstick legend Jerry Lewis.The King of Comedy was, not entirely surprisingly, a flop, the biggest commercial fiasco Scorsese had since he first reached major recognition with 'Mean Streets'. Reviewing it today, it seems like 'The King of Comedy' was years ahead of its time, and underneath a couple of cheap laughs it has disturbing dark undertones that make it one of the most fascinating creations in Scorsese's career. Jerry Lewis plays not the goofy kind of character he's famous for, but is actually quite impressive playing straight man for Robert De Niro, who is nothing short of brilliant (as he always was when working with Scorsese). De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring but obnoxious stand-up comedian who is certain that talk-show superstar Jerry Langford (Lewis) is the one who will help him get to the top. When he realizes that no help is coming his way, Pupkin resorts to desperate measures and kidnaps Langford in order to force him to give him a spot on his show.The premise doesn't sound like much, but it's the construction of Pupkin's character that makes it a truly fascinating watch. Pupkin is ambitious, enthusiastic and eager to please; yet behind his cheerful smile and perfect manners a twisted brain works, as he creates for himself a fantasy world in which he and Langford are best buddies. In a way, Rupert is similar to Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver - like him, he's an almost nave idealist who resorts to violence to achieve his goals in face of the harsh world surrounding him. But Rupert, who seems at first like a harmless eccentric, becomes creepier and more disturbing - and at the same time, almost identifiable - as the film goes by, up to the controversial and disturbing finale. A nice addition is the character of Masha (stand-up comic Sandra Bernhard), Pupkin's eerie sidekick (though exactly how she knows him is unclear), who also has an imaginary relationship with Langford and helps Pupkin with his plans in order to get her own. Masha is in there mainly for laughs, but she also does well in shedding a different light on Pupkin's character, and the interplay between the two is wonderful; Pupkin thinks that Masha is imagining things and treats her with disregard - while Masha, of course, holds pretty much the same opinion about Pupkin. Bernhard finally grants one of the film's most poignant moments when she passionately sings Ray Charles's 'Come Rain Or Come Shine' to a tied and gagged Langford.The King of Comedy is a disturbing film to watch and is not to be taken at face value. It's well recommended, though, a masterpiece by Scorsese that somehow got lost in his huge pile of classics. It's maybe not as universal as Taxi Driver, but it's just as timeless and just as sensitive and inventive. Essential for fans of Scorsese and of De Niro.",0.5,1,34,5,105,0,0,3524,609,1,0.20720551378446114,-0.11666666666666665,57.64,15.64,0.0015297089109171634,0.001523657496056734,0.03142797130316707,0.861829352394072,0.10368930989578702,0.009648127128263337,0.00014184397163120567,3,4.5,0.0543456,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

It's way above your average and better than those Tom Selleck & Robert Duvall westerns we've seen on TNT of late (Lonesome Dove excepted).  Naomi Watts is endearing and compelling as Rebbecca Yoder. But whew Tim Daly cranks up the heat giving an outstanding preformance as Johnny Gault, the wounded ""bad boy"" shootist she takes in. He is one hot man. When he put his hands on Watts for the first time, I thought I'd melt on the spot. Mr. Daly is seriously under-appreciated as a leading man.  The good ending will leave you thinking. It is now one of my favorite TV movies. I agree with the reviewer who wrote, If the devil himself were to come to earth to seduce a woman, he would be Tim Daly as Johnny Gault.

Based on an effective novella about the Vietnam War titled Short-Timers, Kubrick's take on that war and the military (specifically the U.S. Marine Corps.) at that time is one that's very anti-war and also shows the dehumanizing effect that young men go through to become effective soldiers.I agree with Ed that the first half of the film during Corps bootcamp is very effective and also very brutal. The dehumanizing tactics used to turn soldiers like Pvts. Joker, Cowboy and Pyle into killing machines has Kubrick's style written all over it. Kubrick succeeded in showing the brutality of their training, yet still keeps the audience at a distance. Its almost clinical in the way he pulled it off. The stand out performances by R. Lee Ermey as Gunny and a young Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle made the first half of Full Metal Jacket a classic in my book. The second half on the other hand loses some of the effectiveness of the bootcamp scenes.Kubrick tried to show the inhumanity of war through scenes for the Battle for Hue. The scenes are well-shot, but Kubrick's knowledge of city-fighting was very limited and he has talked about it in some detail that he didn't want to really show the battle accurately. He needed a major set piece and the Battle for Hue was a major battle the USMC fought in and used it. This second half is also where he deviated from the book. The book showed the camraderie that Joker and Cowboy had during bootcamp and then throughout Hue and showed that even through war's inhumanity and insanity soldiers kept a bond with their comrades that allowed for heroism to shine through. Kubrick's take on the second half was that war made instant cynics and murderers of people no matter how principled they may be.I may disagree with the second half's treatment of the book and of Kubrick's unsubtle antiwar message, but this film has to count as one of his best. Right up there with The Shining.

904279,B0009ETCUQ,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,3,4,1970-01-01 00:00:01.129334400,A very good homage to classic Italian gialli,"The last year or so has seen the rise of several new directors from France who've made quite a splash with their Hollywood debuts. There's Alejandro Aja with Haute Tension (or Switchblade Romance/High Tension) who brought back the late 70's early 80's sensibilities of what constitutes a good slasher, exploitation film. Then there's Jean-Francois Richet whose 2005 remake of John Carpenter's early classic, Assault on Precicnt 13 surprised quite abit in the industry. Neither film made too much in terms of box-office, but they did show that a new wave of genre directors may not be coming out of the US but from France of all places. Another name to add to this list is Florent Siri and his first major Hollywood project Hostage shows that he has the style and skills to make it in Hollywood.Hostage is another Bruce Willis vehicle that was adapted by Doug Richardson (wrote the screenplay for Die Hard 2) from Robert Crais' novel. Hostage is a very good thriller with a unique twist to the hostage-theme. Willis' character is a burn-out ex-L.A. SWAT prime hostage negotiator whose last major case quickly ended up in the death of suspect and hostages. We next see him as chief of police of a small, Northern California community where low-crime is the norm. We soon find out that his peace of mind and guilt from his last case may have eased since taking this new job, but his family life has suffered as a consequence. All of the peace and tranquility is quickly shattered as a trio of local teen hoodlums break into the opulent home of one Walter Smith (played by Kevin Pollak). What is originally an attempt to steal of of the Smith's expensive rides turn into a hostage situation as mistakes after mistakes are made by the teens.From this moment on Hostage would've turned into a by-the-numbers hostage thriller, but Richardson's screenplay ratchets things up by forcing Willis' character back into the negotiator's role as shadowy character who remain hooded and faceless throughout the film kidnap his wife and daughter. It would seem that these individuals want something from the Smith's home and would kill Willis' character's family to achieve their goals. The situation does get abit convoluted at times and the final reel of the film ends just abit too nicely after what everyone goes through the first 2/3's of the film.The characters in the film are developed enough to give each individual a specific motivation and enough backstory to explain why they ended up in the situation they've gotten themselves into. Willis' performance in Hostage is actually one of better ones in the last couple years. The weariness he gives off during the film is more due to his character's state of mind rather than Willis phoning in his performance. I would dare say that his role as Chief of Police Jeff Talley is his best in the last 2-3 years. The other performance that stands out has to be Ben Foster as the teen sociopath Mars. His character and Foster's performance straddles the line between being comedic and over-the-top. What we get instead is one creepy individual who almost becomes the boogeyman of the film. In fact, the last twenty minutes of Hostage makes Mars into a slasher-film type character who can't seem to die.The real star of the film has to be Florent Siri's direction and sense of style. From the very first frame all the way to the last, Siri gives Hostage the classic 70's and 80's Italian giallo look and feel. Siri's use of bright primary colors in conjuction with the earthy, desaturated look of the film reminds me of some of the best work of Argento, Bava, Fulci and Lenzi. In particular, Siri's film owes alot of its look to films such as Tenebrae, The Bird with the Crystal Plummage, and The Psychic. Certain scenes, especially the penultimate climax in the Smith home, take on an almost dreamlike quality. Siri's homage to the classic giallis even gives Hostage some sequences that would comfortably fit in a 70's slasher film.Florent Siri's Hostage is not a perfect film and at times its increasing tension without any form of release can be unbearable to some people, but it succeeds well enough as a thriller. It also shows that Siri knows his craft well and instead of mimicking and cloning scenes from the giallis he's fond of, he emulates and adds his own brushstrokes. The film is not for everyone and some people may find the story convoluted if not dull at times, but for me the film works well overall. Siri is one director that people should keep an eye on.",0.75,1,44,8,105,0,0,4508,780,1,0.13409685385037498,0.35888888888888887,65.15,71.82,0.0010670470287449851,0.001050186530513371,0.0010532173454742937,0.9058916048462188,0.09093794424904862,0.009760425909494233,0.00016633399866932801,3,,0.0379296,0.6,0.75,,long,
978465,B000ERVKMG,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,4,5,1970-01-01 00:00:01.152230400,Coscarelli takes another Lansdale short story and hits a horror hit,"Don Coscarelli was one of the horror directors invited by Mick Garris to participate and create a full hour episode for the new Showtime horror anthology series, Masters of Horror. Coscarelli accepted and his contribution to the horror anthology series was a telefilm adaptation of Joe R. Lansdale's short story of the same name: ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road."" After watching this Coscarelli installment, I would say that he's succeeded in adapting another one of Lansdale's tales (Bubba Ho-Tep being the other).""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" has the typical backwoods, mutant slasher-killer hunting down your typical babe-in-the-woods female whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Right from the beginning Coscarelli's episode already shows that things might be abit different from your typical slasher story with the immediate memory flashback by the female lead (gamely and beautifully played by the cute-as-a-button Bree Turner). The flashbacks happen throughout the film as Ellen (Turner) remembers the things she learned on how to survive when faced by imminent danger in a strange landscape. For some the sudden break from the high-tension of the chase between the killer, aptly named Moonface, and Ellen might be abit jarring, but the flashbacks do help add backstory to what would have been just a run-of-the-mill slasher tale. The backstory pretty much shows the viewer that Ellen is, or was, married to someone named Bruce (played with deadly seriousness by Ethan Embry) whose obsession with all things survivalist pulled Ellen into the lifestyle of learning how to survive. The flashbacks also show how a perfect marriage and partnership slowly turned abusive in more ways than one. This change of pace in the film makes us root for Ellen to survive her encounter with Moonface as we've invested quite abit in her well-being.I won't say that the film has nothing thrilling to it. When the flashbacks end and we're brought back to Ellen and her current situation things pick up once more. Moonface (played by John De Santis) brings to mind past boogeymen like Leatherface, Jason, and your typical inbred, mountain-men like those in forgettable films like Wrong Turn. He's in the story just to act as the immediate focus for Ellen's baptism of fire, so to speak. He's an unknown entity whose only purpose was to terrorize Ellen and all who gets in his way. He's abit like a force of nature that one either accepts and deals with accordingly or get run over if one in its way. Ellen does the latter and to satisfying result. Coscarelli long-time collaborator Angus Scrimm makes an appearance as Buddy, an old man devoid of sanity after being left in Moonface's care for an undetermined lenght of time. His character brings out feelings of pity, detestation and finally acceptance. Ellen's actions towards Buddy in the end of the film shows that she's accepted his role in all that's happened and feels pity and acceptance to treat the old man the only way she could.People always thought Coscarelli was of the gore-type of horror director, but they'd be wrong to assume that. Throughout all the Phantasm films and up to Bubba Ho-Tep, Coscarelli didn't use much gore in his films. He instead relied to feelings of tension and dread followed up by a sudden shocking scene to the system. In this Masters of Horror episode, we get to see Coscarelli dabble in the magic of gore. He doesn't go to the level that Carpenter did in Cigarette Burns, but the scene with Moonface and his industrial drill was very Fulci-esque. Even with his dabbling with gore sequences, Coscarelli errs on the side of less is more. But the gore that we do see was done by none other than the gore-effects masters from KNB EFX.All in all, Coscarelli's ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" was a fresh new take on an old staple of the horror genre. I would actually label this episode more of a survival story than one of horror, but to each their own. This episode was the second I've seen on dvd and I have to say it's much better than Carpenter's. It bodes well for the rest I've yet to see.",0.8,1,67,11,112,0,0,4115,704,1,0.04722388722388723,0.0,66.07,68.77,0.0011869011103022849,0.0011749133640098928,0.09765915568044861,0.39150548596096374,0.5084735438842755,0.016281895504252734,0.00019436345966958212,3,,0.022896,0.6666666666666666,0.8,,long,

The stinging box office failure of ""Titan A.E."" this past summer has resulted in all the predictable head scratching, second guessing and blame-pointing that inevitably takes place among baffled and chagrined studio executives when a lavishly budgeted and massively promoted film fails to live up to commercial expectations.  Yet the reason for the film's lack of success seems almost painfully obvious.  Had ""Titan A.E."" been made in 1976, for example, (or any year prior to the release of the original ""Star Wars""), it might have seemed innovative and visionary.  One of the glories of animation has always been that it can often create visions and accomplish feats not possible in a live action format.  But when, as is the case of ""Titan,"" the imagery actually derives FROM non-animated works that have already successfully captured those visions on film, the overall effect is one not of innovation but of retrogression.  In other words, ""Titan A. E."" seems to have strangely reversed the course animated and live action films normally follow.  As a result, the sci-fi special effects and the action stunt scenes in ""Titan"" look somehow cheap and tawdry in comparison to the real ones we have seen in countless movies that have come before it.  There is simply nothing in this film to excite an audience that has seen it all before - and often in a considerably more impressive form than it is presented here.Yet, one could almost forgive the technical inadequacy if the film's characters and storyline were not so hackneyed and old fashioned.  Here we are supposed to be watching a tale taking place in the early 31st century, yet nothing about it seems fresh or forward looking.  The story seems mired in all the tired conventions of 1950's Marvel Comic books.  Thus, we have the usual nonsense about how Earth has been annihilated by a race of vicious aliens and how it is up to a cynical, cocky and whiny adolescent (voiced by Matt Damon) to single-handedly save the human race from virtual extinction.  Now the race is on as Bob, one step ahead of his pursuers, searches the universe for the futuristic Noah's Ark - Titan A.E. - his late but obviously prescient father created to help carry on the planet should Earth just happen to someday suffer the inconvenience of being blown to smithereens.  Of course, no reluctant hero would be complete without a sassy, smart and beautiful female cohort (Drew Barrymore) to accompany him on his adventure.  Naturally, early on in their relationship, they engage in a seemingly non-stop barrage of mutual put-downs and insults - that is, of course, until they fall in love and accept the romantic destiny to which they alone have hitherto remained oblivious.  Alas, the equally bland, cardboard villains of the piece also fail to register in any way whatsoever.  (Where is Darth Vader when you need him?)  Similarly ineffective are the obligatory low comic sidekicks that no animated film of any form or stripe can seem to do without.  It seems almost impossible to believe that it took no fewer than three adult screenwriters to concoct this truly witless screenplay.  Most egregious of all is that the film has been fitted with a completely anachronistic and inappropriate rock music soundtrack that shatters any illusion that we could actually be witnessing a story taking place more than one thousand years in the future.Admittedly, ""Titan A.E."" does boast a few effective action sequences and some mighty impressive artwork in the background.  What a shame that it is all essentially thrown away on yet another piece of under-cooked, warmed-over ""Star Wars.""  Icons are icons for a reason and should rarely, if ever, be tampered with.  As those who lost both their shirts and their fortunes on ""Titan A.

Here, Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger, an Interpol agent who's teamed up with Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts), an assistant district attorney of the city of New York, to help bring down a major bank they suspect of brokering arms to terrorists.  When one of his fellow agents is assassinated, Salinger sprints into action, even though, technically, he has no real authority to apprehend the bad guys.Complex, serious and swarming with red herrings, ""The International"" is one of those movies where they throw terms like ""file"" and ""dossier"" around with gleeful abandon - and we relish every minute of it.

Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a feisty young orphan whose uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is hot on the trail of a scientific discovery regarding the nature of the universe - a discovery that, if proven true, could completely upend the paradigm that allows the Magisterium to remain in power.  Naturally, Lyra is one of only a handful of very special people who possess the gift of unlocking the mystery of a golden compass said to hold the key to something or other of great importance (in all honesty, this type of mystical mumbo-jumbo is not exactly my cup of tea).  British and American acting stalwarts Ian McKellen, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Nicole Kidman round out the cast.Much has been made of the supposed anti-religion/pro-science slant in the story (""magisterium"" is the term for the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church), and, indeed, Pullman, a renowned Freethinker, has admitted that he wrote his trilogy of fantasy novels (called, collectively, ""His Dark Materials"") partly as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis' ""Narnia"" series - though the Magisterium doesn`t seem to be any more objectionable as a literary device than the societal super-structures we find in ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"" or ""Fahrenheit 451,"" or countless other such tales (though I gather that the movie somewhat dilutes this aspect of the original story anyway).If truth be told, I really don`t have much use for films of this genre, but I will say that I find the movie version of ""The Golden Compass"" to be a bit more imaginative and a trifle less plodding than the recent cinematization of ""Chronicles of Narnia.""  Plus, ""Compass"" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet.

And there are no such things as mediocre comments on this kind of Very Special Films.But, of course, there is no such phenomenon: every movie has it's mediocre reactions and a whole bunch of viewers who will say after the screening ""Oh, okay. Nice. Pretty good huh?"" But it's fun to think that these kind of Very Special Films can provoke controverion and mass pumped-up hysteria.We've seen it with movies like ""Brazil"", ""Eraserhead"", ""Begotten"", ""Stranger than paradise"" and ""The Tenant"". Arthouse darlings with a cult following and a lynching mob to go with it. Often over-stylized, so that the form, the off-beat technical approach either sucks you in or completely puts you off.The content? Often challeging subjects, wrapt in meptaphorical or surreal stories. It's cinema on the edge, and it either let's you walk there with it, or pushes you over.Okay, so, here is ""The Reflecting Skin"", and I tell you, it is one of those movies you either think is the best you've ever seen or the worst kind of pretentious crap in years.The story is about a bunch a young kids doing all kinds of naughty things kids tend to do because, well... because they are kids.Like blowing up a live frog in the face of a woman immediately after the opening credits. Okay, a little teenage horror comedy we have here, but it's the filmstyle of debutant Philip Ridley that sets the tone right away: his training as a professional art painter has taught him all about imagery, (camera) angels, and use of striking colours.So the infinite fields of rye the three boys, Seh and his two buddies, stand in are harshly yellow, the summer sky is blindingly blue, the entire panorama very painterish pittoresque and within it the victim: the Muze, in this case a mysterious young woman, her hair blond as the sunrays, her clothing black as the grieving night. And when the kids make the frog explode, her mysterious pale face is splashed with blood that is redder then the veriest red you've ever seen when you witness a live frog explode.All this filled with bombastic orchesral music for hysterical strings and dito women's choir.And it works. It completely works. That is... for me. Because I am one of those people in the audience that is suckered into this gem from this very opening.It did and still does it for me because I see the over-done form as made by an adult director who still has the heart of a child. And the child in him likes to play and make people laugh at darkly, almost forbidden things.So more delicious non-sense (or rather nightmare-sense) ingredients follow: A mother who seems to suffer from daily life and tends to smells gasoline all through the house any moment of the day, a dad who reads pulp novels and carries a hidden secret, there is the mourning young widow who ceeps a small wooden case filled with bodily left-overs from her lover who committed suicide, a drunk rock-throwing priest, and a shining black car with four strange guys dressed in black that rides all throught out the picture on moments you'd least expect it.Then dead bodies begin to turn up: the kids, one by one they disappear and are found back later in abandoned crooked sheds throughout the infinitely strechtched out acres. More wicked David Lynchian (!) people turn up, do their things, say their lines and vanish.Then dad commits suicide after getting the blame for the dead kiddies and as a result, Seth's bigger brother Viggo Mortensen comes home.(Yes, that's Our Viggo, long before the ""Rings""-fame. And he fits right in, completing his catchy silent-character-quatroligy; together with ""The Indian Runner"", ""Prison"" and ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"" .)The plot meanwhile keeps on twisting and twisting and when all ends in death, guilt and beauty, Seth, the remaining kid, has underwent an instand-catharsis, a blitztrip to adulthood and a cinematic tour-de-force, rolled in to one.And, o yes, all this in a brilliant, bursting, and flaming sunset no movie goer has ever experienced before. The best or the worst, that's for all of us to fight out.",0.75,1,43,8,162,2,1,4266,730,1,0.0655456247871978,0.0,65.96,105.66,0.0011799181693400104,0.001178386008527539,0.001172632728797916,0.42863825065200356,0.5678308124413309,0.010079699953117674,0.00017576751816264356,1,,0.0,0.6,0.75,3.0,long,

Still, it's captivating.The performances are excellent all around and (though R.

Richard struggles with the separation from his wife until he meets Christine, an eccentric artist who doesn't starve only because she chauffeurs the elderly. Richard's sons find love, one conversationally on the internet, and the other physically from the neighborhood girls who want to experiment with him. The movie was written and directed by Miranda July who also starred in the film as Christine.I thought it was good, but not great. I loved the incorporation of the name of the movie into the theme of the story. I thought that was great. I enjoyed the well-written dialogue. It was certainly an interesting film, just not the most entertaining. Some parts of the movie seemed to move too slowly, though I can appreciate that, to an extent, it was done on purpose (see also: artistically). The movie received some pretty harsh reviews from family and friends, but I am happy I still took the time to see it.

I just watched the Heiress for the fifth time and while I was quite taken by her characterization of Catherine Sloper when I first watched it, after a recent viewing she began to wear on me. To me, her performance lacks subtlety. I usually love performances of women that start out silly and nave and slowly mature. I can see that with Audrey Hepburn in War and Peace, Romola Garai in Emma and Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. However, I feel like something is not right with de Havilland. I can't exactly put my finger on what it is. She has the right face, personality and demeanor and looks positively smashing in 18th century gowns--especially the one at the end--and to be frank she conveys the emotions of Catherine very well with her face, especially her eyes--but what annoys me is that she uses two kinds of voices---in the first half as the silly, shy, namby pamby girl--she's got this breathy, high, hysterical cutie pie voice begging you to go ""AWWW. She's so ADORABLE."" And then in the next half after being thwarted in love she has a slow, low, raspy, hollow, Lauren Bacall smoker's voice. There are no shades of gray in her performance, no foreshadowing of the fully accomplished, wiser woman that is to come. She is either black or white. It's a two note performance that grates on my nerves. I felt like Mister Tee in the Unofficial Academy Award Discussion Board (Best Actress 1949 page) took the words out of my mouth when he likened her to ""A switch turned on and off."" I once read (I can't remember where) that William Wyler took up to thirty takes to get `just the right expression/gesture"" from her so maybe he overanalyzed the character and is partly to blame for guiding her in this direction.It doesn't help matters either that she has to play off the unforgivably bad performance of Montgomery Clift as her suitor Morris. I liked Clift in A Place in the Sun, From Here to Eternity (I don't like the story in FHTE but I have to admit he was great there) and Judgment at Nuremburg but here he seems to have no emotions. He has only two expressions--a seedy smile and a deadpan, blank, horizontal mouth--and his weak, breathy voice is unappealing. I don't blame him one bit for walking out of the theater at the premiere. I would have been totally disgusted too.Also, the movie has an overall, claustrophobic feel like a stage play instead of a movie. There's not a lot of spacious outside scenes and the camera work in the house is just plain dull--master shot, over the shoulder, close up, master shot, over the shoulder, etc.) William Wyler has to shoulder on some of the blame for that too.Ralph Richardson, on the other hand acts the socks off them as the grouchy, sarcastic father who tells it like it is. His subtle facial expressions (like when his daughter announces her engagement, the twinkle in his eye at the party when he says ""Remember her mother, Liz? Her mother who had so much grace and gaiety?"" and the constipated look when Morris says goodbye to Catherine on the ship) are amazing and he delivers his lines with such crisp speed, wit and dramatic flourish that I found myself liking this character the best even though the script obviously didn't want me to. How Olivia di Havilland managed to win an Oscar and not Richardson when he runs rings around her just totally baffles me.Miriam Hopkins is excellent as the goofy, air-headed aunt and can be stupid and annoying in a very funny sort of way. I cracked up when she makes her speech towards the end. ""Oh Catherine! We have him back! I was afraid you would turn him away. But I have faith in love like this. I hope I always stay romantic. And you know what? You are much more romantic than you know!""Also the pacing is very sluggish at times. Some scenes go on way too long. For instance, when Catherine says goodnight to her father after telling him about her engagement she rushes up the stairs to tell her aunt. After she leaves the room, we see the doctor looks confused, tired and worried; he obviously doesn't want just ANYONE marrying his daughter. But after she goes up the stairs we get another close up of him lying on the couch with the same concerned look. Catherine wakes her aunt up to tell her about her engagement and the aunt congratulates her and it looks like the scene is going to end and move on to the next day. But NO! We get a THIRD close up of the doctor! We already saw his reaction after Catherine left the room. We don't need to be beat over the head with it three times. Come on Wyler! Wrap up the scene and move on!I will say, the storyline was very engaging and the subject matter thought provoking. I liked how the script treated the father/daughter relationship very carefully and sensitively to where I could see the full dimension of their characters. I could see they both had their faults and virtues and even though they have a major fall-out they do not exactly hate each other. It would have been so much easier to make Dr. Sloper hate Catherine and Catherine love him then hate him at the end but because of the careful balance of the script I could see they weren't merely on one side of the love/hate see-saw--they were just teetering in the middle. It certainly has a message: be wise in matters of the heart and you cannot unsay an unkind work and that conclusion where she tricks Morris to show him she's not dumb enough to fall for him twice since now she knows him inside and out was VERY satisfying.Taken as a whole, this isn't a bad adaption of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's play but it could have been better.",0.0,1,61,11,176,3,7,6108,1089,1,0.0325250212750213,0.0,69.01,77.23,0.0007578127396253235,0.0007597267226735336,0.0007573934678053049,0.5645689982182265,0.4331560688516694,0.009986902423051735,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,long,

I never really liked Outkast until Hey ya! came out -- or at least, I never knew I liked them. What is so wrong with that? I DON'T LIKE RAP! So sue me if I only jumped on the bandwagon now.Anyone will tell you that their sound is unique. What these two guys make together is music, plain and simple. The first song sets the atmosphere, the second song is depressing, and then the next one is a total trip, and it just gets better from there.I may just be a white boy who know nothing about these guys or hip hop, but I know what I like, and I liked just about everything on this DVD. For the price, it's a steal. The thing that made me feel so fortunate to have this DVD is, every time the next song came on, I'd say &quot;Hey, I know this song, always wanted to have it on CD.&quot; I didn't know &quot;Fresh and Clean&quot; but I was so digging it right away.There is no way to categorize the music. Each video sets out to master and appropriate a different sound, a different genre. There's rap, soul, salsa, they even tried to copy the Beatles. But while they do build off of other genres, they never fail to give the sound something special, something intensely pleasing, something for the popular audience. And in the process, their style evolves as well...The song that they place as their signature tune is &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; -- art, and it's the background music for the main menu page. For those of you unfamiliar with the video, &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; is an R&amp;B piece about a breakup that takes place sometime after the couple has a child.. His house is falling apart, his roof is leaking -- an allegory for his troubled circumstances. Yet he defends his move to the end, even as his frustrations grow deeper, his household a ruin..

Many of the negatives about it stemed from the fact that instead of looking at the piece as story about dreaming and loss innocence, too many writers got caught up in looking at technical stuff as we have been taken been over and captured in the hi-tech world of ipods, blackberries, hi-def, hi-tech innovation, hi-gadgetry and the god of science and hi-innovation. Dreaming somehow is lost and that is good because it is has no circuits and logic boards to examine therefore can dreaming be good for us?Critics nitpicked and complain about technical mistakes in term of aspects of the rocket. Why was more not shown of them building the rocket? The fuel mixture was crazy. One person could never build such a device. To complicated for one. It would never fly and other technicalities on and on. However, their complaints are while perhaps somewhat legit are also irrelevant in the space of the story. It is not about space or rockets or fuel ratios anymore than Field of Dreams was tale of baseball. It is entertainment first and foremost and a metaphor for the dreamers amongus.The Polish Brothers wanted to make a more Hollywood type piece but true to their sensibility would not give in to the Hollywood model and wanted to tell the story in their own way. This film would not have worked if the big Hollywood machine had been trucked in with high price gunslingers playing the parts. It is the Polish brother's material and thankfully they kept with their own ideals and Kudos' to them for sticking to their personal vision. Listen to the praise in the DVD from comments by Billy Bob Thornton and others that he gives the Polish Brothers so much credit for staying with their ideals.This story does not resonate with many of who are have become cynics to anything not empirical thus and given up on dreaming. Dreams are dangerous. They are a threat to many who believe in big brother or the experts and government for directing telling them what can be done and what is right or wrong. As the film and its commentary notes, we have lost the magic of believing we can do anything we want if and believe it hard enough and put enough effort in to make it happen.Yes, to enjoy the film your belief must be suspended. However, you do that in most films anyway so it is not a huge issue. The idea is building of a rocket is stretching things. So be it. Although note that in the real world at last 1 person has tried to follow the example of what Charles Farmer was doing in the picture.It is family centered about  people supporting each other and believing in something so much and supporting themselves standing alone when society has dictated what want to do in cant be done because experts have forbidden it. As the characters say we have many laws to protect from other laws. The film hints we are being driven by legislated common sense. Family values rooted in a world where the concept of family is broken down. As Ms. Madsen herself says in her comments, it is about family with heart and soul and being told in the right way. This does come across in the piece whether you believe the rocket could work or pigs fly.There is electric chemistry between Madsen and Thornton. They light up the screen in the support for each other. Thornton was a great casting choice, Very much the guy next door you could like and Madsen is his pillar and counterpoint. (Spoiler alert coming) really letting her husband (Thornton know when she starts to see the rocket idea affecting the family core values and structure). The flying saucer scene shows Madsen's great strength as an actress going from two opposite ends of emotions and coming back in a to where she began in powerful believable piece of acting.It is good storytelling all around. Polish Brothers show they have depth and want to take their turn to make a more glossy Hollywood type production on their own terms with their own edge and humor.Appropriate that the rocket was called the Dreamer. Perhaps this might have been a title. The dream, the dreamer and loss of that dream magic with a few hard life lessons added in were all woven together This resonated with me through the film.Was it perfect no? But as a creative dreamer, I connected with the message and the believable characters. I was not overly picked that science was not perfect.tms",0.0,2,62,9,70,3,0,4355,774,1,0.19158506595126315,0.5,70.53,53.88,0.03223638993899417,0.02248446246214647,0.0011938478982015577,0.6964282799243408,0.24765701977631704,0.01423650975889782,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

Each episode is as tighly written and superbly acted as an excellent movie, but the series structure allows creator David Chase and his writers to expand and complicate the characters as you would in a serialized novel. The effect is like a collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Charles Dickens! You feel that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; gives the most complete picture of life in the mob of any movie or TV series ever; &quot;The Godfather&quot; and even &quot;GoodFellas&quot; seem hopelessly romanticized by comparison. (Tellingly, Tony's crew quotes &quot;The Godfather&quot; constantly, trying to make their sordid lives into the stuff of movie glamor.) Virtually every character on the show is complex and interesting enough to devote an entire column to, but you can't write anything meaningful about &quot;The Sopranos&quot; without discussing the central character, Tony Soprano. Greedy and violent, yet also possessed of charm and organizational ability, Tony seems to have compartmentalized his life comfortably into his &quot;business&quot; life--i.e. stealing and murdering--and his family life. That is, until he starts having blackouts... In any case, Tony is a larger-than-life character, and James Gandolfini does an incredible job in bringing him to life, with all his contradictions, doubts and sudden rages. As Gandolfini plays him, Tony is Henry VIII with a Joisey accent, or Ralph Kramden with a .38. All the other performers--Edie Falco as Carmela, Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Melfi, Michael Imperioli as Christopher--likewise manage incredible balancing acts with their characters. But special mention must be made of Nancy Marchand--formerly famous for playing patrician roles--as Livia, Tony's bitter and paranoid mom, an emasculating mother if there ever was one.",0.6666666666666666,1,41,9,94,0,1,2101,318,1,0.2687830687830688,1.0,49.96,96.18,0.0022324499316746745,0.051561616836721814,0.48463519174147474,0.45934704685947697,0.0022236946306517236,0.01951451689671585,0.0003171582619727244,4,3.6666666666666665,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,4.0,long,

My reviews focus only on the quality of the audio and video transfer to Blu Ray.The video transfer was considerably better than I had expected.  I do have the Standard Def DVD as well but this is not a side by side comparison.  The cinematography becomes interesting to me and popped for me in this Blu Ray production.  While most of the color grading was warm, the evening shots were all shot with a cool blue and the transitions sometimes seemed abrupt.  There was good detail in the dark and shadow areas, yet there seemed to be a softness to the edging of many details.  This is only important to very few who might be interested in technical aspects of the transfer, which I am.  For the most part, the video transfer was just fine with excellent color saturation and a lack of noticeable film grain.  Contrast was also excellent and the colors in the daytime Florida scenes were stunning.  There was no aliasing or artifacts that I could see, and the Mbps rate was very high seeming  to average between the high 20's and mid thirties which shows in the clean transfer.  Whether this film was remastered or not, I cannot say, I don't think so, but the video transfer really appears quite clean.The lossless DTS MA 5.1 audio is the technical star of the Blu Ray with truly fine use of the front and rear sound stages.  I did not expect this to be so but there was a good deal of directionality with many of the foley fx and discreet channeling abounded, even if it was simply a subtle audio effect.  It's rare you get such fine audio with only subtle effects making it so. Usually we expect explosions and jets to provide those enveloping home theater effects but in The Red Dragon, it is left to the small bits and pieces of discreet use.

Mulan was a wonderful movie, especially for young girls, because even though Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Belle and Pocohantas are good rolemodels, Mulan is more of the 'every girl' .

I am a huge fan of movies and an even bigger fan of cheesy, low budget horror movies, but this thing just leaves me without words. I can't even believe that Clint Howard decided to be in it, and he's been in some winners.I wasn't expecting much, maybe an hour and a half of entertaining blood and gore, super cheesy acting, and something of a plot. I didn't get any of that. The only thing that kept me going was the sheer amazement that this thing was ever approved to be shipped out. My rats could write a more intelligent story line, and they could probably act better too.And then it happened... They decided to throw in some random shots of the video game. Being stupefied already, I think I lost several brain cells when this occurred. Now why would you do that? Someone actually thought it would be a good idea to add scenes from a dated video game, to what, enhance the movie? And then a bunch of other people agreed to it! Why??! I'm all for video games, believe me. But that was just wrong.The fact that during the intro the narrator had to describe every characters purpose in the film should say something. Instead of incorporating some kind of character building dialog, they decided to list it all out for you right in the beginning. There was the stupid one, the comic relief, and the three girls, who I can't remember what they were good for. Then all through the movie they kept trying to verify the characters descriptions at the beginning. You know, by calling the stupid one, ""stupid"", and by telling the comic relief that he was, ""goofy"". There was no comic relief and they were all stupid. And then at the very beginning they go and tell you that everyone dies. So there you go. Heck, all you need to watch is the first few minutes and you'll be all set to turn it off. You could just imagine what happens, and it would probably be more entertaining and make more sense.Oh man, and don't you know it I checked out the extras. The deleted scenes to be exact, because I couldn't even fathom what they decided was not movie material. It was bad, really bad. I mean boom mics galore and just the most awkward, brain dead acting ever.I love cheesy films, I live for them. But this movie had absolutely no cheese to it. It was just sad. Very, very sad. There are about a sea of zombie movies I would recommend instead of this one. DEAD-ALIVE, being my favorite movie of all time and then the EVIL DEAD series after that (Bruce Campbell is my hero). In fact, I don't think you can get any worse than the HOUSE OF THE DEAD.

Rosemary Clooney stars as beautiful Calaveras Kate, a saloon singer in Western town called Limbo County, California. The story revolves around a man called Reb Randall (Guy Mitchell) who comes to town seeking the killer of his brother. The people of Limbo County believe in the Code of the West, which simply means he has to fight the killer to avenge the death of his brother. The town refuses to accept the civilized laws with the recently arrived Judge Winthrop (Reginald Owen), who is there to enforce such laws. But soon it turns out that it is not a problem, because his beautiful niece falls in love with the killer, Rafael Moreno (Gene Barry); Calaveras is in love with the local leader Jason Carberry (Jack Carson), and Jason Carberry's niece Susana (Pat Crowley) is in love with Reb Randall. Love and romance conquers the terrible fight. Limbo County comes to believe that it is time to do away with the Code of the West.This is an excellent musical with colored costumes and stylized d&eacute;cor, but the quality of DVD could have been better. Rosemary Clooney is attractive as ever in her colorful salon suit and red garters. She is captivating and entertains the audience with her beautiful voice and dancing skills.

They don't have the training to do so.It's too hard to believe the mutiny.The weapons drill after the fire was unbelievable.  A fire on a ship is too dangerous and unpredictable to have crew be doing any other major event at the same time or even shortly after. The captain would have to KNOW the fire event is completely resolved before doing something else with the crew.Besically this movie requires you to believe that a person has come through the ranks and is near the top of their game while ignoring common sense.

Revenge of the Dead is the movie Zeder under a different name.  Don't buy the ROTD version, but do buy the slightly superior version  called Zeder that is also offered on this sight on VHS or DVD.  With that  clarified, let me get on with my review:  This movie ROCKS!  I have never  seen anything like it!  It's part conspiracy movie and part zombie flick.  Oh, and despite popular belief, Zombies ARE in this flick.  They get about  two minutes of screen time at the end of the movie (before that, we only  heard them breath or see their shadow) and their make-up job consists  entirely of only pale gray skin, but they are still creepy and cool.  The  violence level is also minimum.  This has all of the ingrdients of a  borefest of an Italian zombie flick (the fact that it runs for over 100  minutes doesn't help either), but the director makes it work.  It is  suspenseful, entertaining, and overall well done.  The zombies (when  they're around anyway) are some of the best ever.  They are fairly  intelligent (by zombie standards anyway), elusive (we usually only hear  them or see a shadow, like I said before.  There are no brainless armies of  the living dead here.), and just plain SCARY!  If you are expecting a  Romero or Fulci style zombie flick, you will be disapointed.  This film  demands its viewers to THINK for once and NOT be mindlessly entertained by  gore and mayhem.  The plot is a bit hard to follow, so you will have to  concentrate hard while watching.  If you can do that, you will have a great  time.  If you can't, go watch some brainless crap like Zombie 3 or Doctor  Butcher(fun films but still garbage).

Here's a list of the extras you'll get...commentary by Sylvester McCoy & Sophie Aldred, deleted scenes, out-takes, on screen production note subtitles, multi-angle scenes, the original trailers, photo galleryThs commentary is pretty good. More consistent and informative than the Robots of Death Commentary but not quite as entertaining as The Five Doctors Commentary or the Caves of androzani Commentary. Sophi and Sylvester talk a lot about things that happened on the set and the careers of some of their costars in the story. Pretty interesting stuff...On another note... if you're looking for new Dr. Who material. Look for the audio releases of the missing episodes. Look for my list ""Missing Dr. Who's on Audio and Video"" to find out about this. [....]Look for ""The Web of Fear"" for starters. ""The Dalek's Master Plan"" Audio Release is awsome too. Also check out Big Finnish productions for the new audio adventures of Dr. Who featuring Doctors ranging from Peter Davison to Paul Mcgann. Was this review helpful?

With &quot;The Mexican&quot; with Brad Pitt &amp; Julia Roberts &amp; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; with Johnny Depp, he's shown great directorial versatility.  Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is also excellent, as this is a visually handsome film.  Naomi Watts does a good job as Rachel Keller working her way through this mystery.  Martin Henderson who is currently in theatres with &quot;Torque&quot; does a great job as the sensitive hunk Noah.  David Dorfman who was in &quot;Bounce&quot; with Ben Affleck &amp; Gweneth Paltrow turns in a spooky minimalist performance as the son Aidan.  Both Watts &amp; Dorfman should be back for &quot;Ring 2.&quot;  Brian Cox does a good job as Richard Morgan who is so distraught that he electrocutes himself.  (Since he won't be back for R2; it's a good thing for him that they're doing a second &quot;Bourne Identity&quot;!)  Amber Tamblyn from the &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; series on TV does a brief but good job at the beginning of the film as the frightened teen.  Ehren Kruger, whose &quot;Arlington Road&quot; screenplay was very good, does a good job in building the suspense.  Jane Alexander is always excellent, but I had to strain to see her with grey hair!  I didn't know if the part of Samara really worked for me.  Having a child be the force of evil is a bit hard to accept.  The scene on the ferry with the horse was thoroughly engrossing.

Harris and James Woods concocting this imitative thriller. There is nothing new in ""Cop"", but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch. I'm of the opinion that any film that Woods appears in is never totally a dead loss. All the elements are present, a broken family life, a pariah in his own department, a cop who works outside the rules, a psycho murderer leaving clues written in blood. Woods plays the role with his usual wisecracking intensity and is good value for money.  The difference I suppose this film has is its exploration of feminist ideologies, but there are far too many ambiguities within the convoluted plot for any sense too be made of them. Ultimately like most of these cop thrillers, it is a tale of revenge, a case of the return of the repressed, as forgotten memories resurface to the top. James B. Harris is perhaps best known for his short production partnership with Stanley Kubrick in the late 1950's early 60's. From the evidence here, he should strictly stick to production. The film suffers from a visual flatness and very unimaginative direction, ultimately given the impression of a made for TV movie. With anyone else at the helm this could have become an impressive production, but too many elements jar and the film lacks a totalising cohesion. Nevertheless despite these shortcomings ""Cop"" is an interesting curiosity, which is worth a watch.",0.5,1,26,3,40,0,0,1475,254,1,0.19162457912457911,0.5,60.14,-50.02,0.002836551622267843,0.0028707673078943773,0.002850406800909807,0.8078904379815239,0.18355183628740399,0.017627118644067796,0.00033875338753387534,2,,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

His excellent satires of the Vietnam conflict and the counter-culture in ""Death Dream"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" respectively, often get overlooked. The same can be said for his prototype slasher film ""Black Christmas"". The credit tends to be given to ""Halloween"", although a superior film, Carpenter's effort steals wholesale a number of motifs from Clark's film which went on to define the slasher film (point of view shots from the killer's perspective, a seasonal connection, sexually precocious teenagers etc). Where Clark's film differs is in its implied nastiness. The killer, judging from his vitriolic phone manner is one of cinema's true enigmas. Never glimpsed, Clark does stretch things somewhat by having the psycho live in the sorority house. We only get tantalising hints as to the killers mixed up mental state. The reason Clark is able to leave his film so open-ended and so riddled with more questions than answers is because it was an independent production, and this probably explains its disappearance into the mists of film history. Nevertheless the film has some notable actors (Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Margot Kidder), which have helped to ensure it has something of a cult following. ""Black Christmas"" is an essential stepping stone in the development of 1970's horror and must be rewritten into the canon of key horror works.",0.75,1,35,5,49,0,0,1547,249,1,0.16150137741046833,0.375,57.0,32.56,0.0030915624875932613,0.028493678517491853,0.0030761731473729465,0.7309606302502678,0.2343779555972741,0.02262443438914027,0.00048449612403100775,2,,0.0001728,0.6,0.75,4.333333333333333,long,

No real surprises here. It's better than the original in some ways, and in others- not as good. One thing I did like is the way the film took time to build the paranormal activity to the point that it escaladed slowly so that it was believable. But at the same time it took too long. It felt like eternity. Once the real scary stuff beings it get's a little bit cheesy for my taste. And frankely the end seemed kind of stupid. And there was some clear reminders of the Blair Witch project. This is the kind of film that should scare people that are effected by silly horror films like Scream, but for harcore horror fans this will keep your attention but it's not going to blow you away. Most of what works about this film is what you fear is going to happen. In reality if your imagination is runing wild, what you imagine is probably a hundred times better than what actually happens. But on the other hand I don't anyone would expect a sequal like this to be anything but a total flop, and the film is far from that territory. I did in fact jump a couple of times, and a couple of scenes did creep me out a bit, but the portions of the film that are mean to really scare you just seem rather dumb.",1.0,0,39,7,28,0,0,1269,247,1,0.018103448275862074,0.25625,80.11,89.75,0.0026068481496243022,0.0025972080884606075,0.002598053903265629,0.002624713505004236,0.9895731763536453,0.030732860520094562,0.0007874015748031496,2,4.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,,long,

Great score.Surprisingly for a prison film, there is lots of humor, at the beginning some found in the notion that one could go to an oppressive road gang for just cutting the tops off of parking meters. Or, the woman washing her car with suds all over her breasts and DragLine's (G. Kennedy) great quote: &quot;Anyone with a face so sweet... and a body like that MUST be named Lucille&quot;! Unlike another reviewer, I was pleased to see a film about life in prison that did not include a rape scene.The notion of a rebel against authority (remember, though, that Luke was not too much of a rebel, because he won a Silver Star in the war) is one that resonates with lots of folks (and not just yuppies or baby boomers). How can one not identify with Newman, who is less than enthused about a &quot;lot of guys, spouting off a bunch of rules and regulations&quot;. ANYONE who ever wanted to say to a boss &quot;just because its your job don't make it right&quot; ought to be able to identify with Luke on some level.But like many great films (among which I count this one), its a simple film. One guy who won't submit among a band of others who have decided that it was easier for them to submit. Another reviewer says its like a slow lazy day. Nothing wrong with that, and like a slow lazy day, this film it can be enjoyed over and over again, and comes around far too infrequently.

While the film takes a few liberties with the details, it follows the main phases of the battle quite accurately.  After the conquest of France, Germany offered peace on generous terms.  Churchill refused, recognizing that the Royal Navy could prevent the Germans from sending an army across the English Channel.  As a result, the battle became an aerial war, in which England faced a serious numerical disadvantage.  From early July through early August 1940, the Luftwaffe mainly attacked British shipping.  Starting on August 12, the Germans began a series of attacks on RAF airfields.  This would be the most difficult phase of the battle for England.  Factories could replace the lost aircraft, but the RAF was critically short of pilots.  Then, on September 7, the Germans turned on London, which proved to be the decisive mistake: it enabled the RAF to counterattack in large numbers.  Finally, after sustaining heavy losses in a massive air battle on September 15, the Germans abandoned the plan to invade England.  The air battles are spectacular, but the film also recognizes that a key element in England's victory was superior information: radar, and a centralized communications system enabled the RAF to scramble its planes, preventing the Luftwaffe bombers from destroying them on the ground.  This is historical film-making at its best.",1.0,0,21,3,35,0,0,1465,234,1,0.12234432234432235,0.08,53.21,9.21,0.004547437628521205,0.004469970197236081,0.0047628299577908316,0.9816985894501251,0.004521172766326848,0.014334470989761093,0.0006821282401091405,1,,0.0,0.5,0.0,5.0,long,

Explosions, slo-mos, fast cuts, silhouettes - every editing trick in the book is in this MTV flick, which moves so jarringly even on a tv screen that I wonder how people watched this on the big screen.The irony is that Domino is based on the life of a real life bounty hunter.  The cinematic stakes are pushed so high however, that it's hard to see the reality that this is based on.  The actors here are understandably but totally glamourised - so much so that the grit comes off as false.  It's typical Tony Scott gloss which is fine if that's what you're after.It would've been interesting to see how another director would've handled this as a real bio-pic, rather than as a hollywood shebang.  I thought about that as I watched the behind the scenes documentary that unveils the real Domino Harvey (to some degree), one reason to buy the DVD if you've watched and liked the film.The real Domino looks like an androgynous David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust days. The screen Domino is played by Kiera Knightley, who comes across quite pretentious, but then again, was the real Domino like that?Other reasons to watch this: Mickey Rourke who is absolutely back in form, and Beverly Hills 90210 alumni Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green, who do the most courageous thing in the whole film by playing and lampooning themselves.Domino also features eclectic cameos by Lucy Liu, Jacqueline Bisset, Tom Waits, Christopher Walken, Dabney Coleman...who else have I missed out?",0.0,2,39,6,48,2,0,1622,279,1,0.08136904761904762,0.0,66.88,73.85,0.2340901770399298,0.002751667926178657,0.0027455720476648356,0.35578296502650064,0.404629617959726,0.02404438964241677,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,long,

But, this really was beyond me.The film is brilliant, it's a remarkable achievement, and I'm not talking about the animation or the technology, I'm talking about the extreme maturity and intelligence with which the film is narrated, as Nemo, Incredibles has above average character development, it surpases many regular films, and within the genre, it surpases Spider Man. Now, I'm probably going to get based, but Spider Man is no where near the brilliance of The Incredibles, it is an extremely entertaining film, with lot's of depth, in both story and character, the film is perfect, it fullfills all of it's aspirations and surpases them.Now, some have bashed the movie on the basis that the film takes heavy cues off Fantastic Four and Spy Kids, the answer, yes the film does have strong foundations from those two, but, neither of them on their better moments amount to what Incredibles has achieved, and besides, the whole point of the movie is that works within that genre, what GREAT genre movies do is they take a overdone and weary genre, give it a fresh, innovative and clever spin and turn it into a new level(similar to what Scorsese did with GoodFellas, don't get me wrong, I'm not comparing GoodFellas with Incredibles, I'm comparing the look towards the individual genres each films takes.)The Incredibles as all Pixar films cover all demographics, Incredibles has something for everyone, and those who don't find it funny, and find it too slow, well, Pixar never set out to do Airplane funny, and making fun of other stuff like Shrek is way too easy, Incredibles has it's share of laughs. And it's not too slow, it only takes it's time to build the characters, so that when the film takes a fast pace, it's not juts for the kicks, important things are at stake, characters are important. It's stupid to bash a film because it takes it'ts time to build it's characters, which seems a forgotten art in Hollywood this days(particularly action/adventure). The film not only is concerned on being exiting, explosive and entertaining, but that it has a logical and interesting story, with clearly defined characters.To sum up, the film to my opinion raises the bar in not just animated cinema, but cinema all together.On an extra note, the film has a superb use of music, remenisant to James Bond soundtracks, very catchy, and used with incredible skill.",0.8,2,31,6,88,0,0,2603,443,1,0.22981060606060605,0.0,42.48,73.85,0.0015989899780031085,0.07236438908016588,0.029852297492600603,0.3929210565605679,0.5032632668886624,0.011909335382251248,0.00030721966205837174,1,,0.0,0.7272727272727273,1.6,5.0,long,

Upon beaming to the surface, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy discover the inhabitants gone and a library containing the planet's  accumulated knowledge.  Kirk, Spock and McCoy are surprised to find a lone  inhabitant on the surface, Mr. Atoz, the librarian, who mistakes them for  citizens of Sarpeidon. Mr. Atoz has been transferring people into the  planet's past using a machine called the &quot;atavachron&quot;. While  investigating this unique technology, Kirk leaps to rescue a woman he hears  screaming and ends transported to a period fraught with superstitions and  witchcraft. Attempting to follow Kirk, Spock and McCoy enter the  atavachron's portal to find themselves in a different time -- Sarpeidon's  ice age.  McCoy, who is close to freezing to death, and Spock are rescued  by a beautiful woman, Zarabeth. While close to the portals they entered  from, Kirk, Spock and McCoy can communicate with each other but little  more. However, this is enough to get Kirk arrested for practicing  witchcraft.  Spock increasingly finds himself attracted to Zarabeth, and  disturbingly more emotional and irrational, and even takes to eating meat.  McCoy convinces Spock that this time in Sarpeidon's past is linked to  Vulcan's primitive past and that they must return to their own time.  Zarabeth insists they cannot return to the present without dying.  In jail,  Kirk is befriended by a lawyer, another traveler of Sarpeidon's present,  who helps him escape to find the portal, and return to the library.  Zarabeth helps McCoy and Spock to the place where she found them. By  following the sound of Kirk's voice, they find their portal and leap back  into the library.

The films artfully gritty atmosphere is perhaps its best selling feature, though, truth be told, there is nothing about the production that is second rate. Basically, it's a jewel heist caper gone horribly wrong but carried off with such panache and attention to detail by director, John Huston that one has to admire both the economy of plot and depth of characters fleshed out within the context of two hours. Huston's great knack for extolling unusual and breakthrough performances from his ensemble is working overtime on this occasion. While we might be used to seeing Sam Jaffe as a nefarious rogue (here, he's Doc, the criminal mastermind with a weakness for hoop earrings and tight skirts), the extraordinary off kilter performance of Louis Calhern - as middle aged fencer, Ennrich/sugar daddy to Marilyn Monroe, is so menacing in its undertone, that one wishes the actor had been given the opportunity to play more such parts.  There is nothing cartoonish or clich&eacute; about any of the characters in the film. Sterling Hayden's particularly powerful as Dix Handley, the tense enforcer of the group. This is a story about out of control people losing control of their lives. Huston captures the immediacy of these tragic lives and the overwhelming sense of doom. As one might expect, it ends badly for all concerned though, within the context of this review I won't say exactly how.The transfer on ""The Asphalt Jungle"" is better than average, though it's not perfect. The gray scale has a richly balanced look with deep solid blacks and clean whites. On occasion grain looks heavier than it should and contrast levels seem a tad low. Still, this DVD is considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes. Age related artifacts are present but do not terribly distract.  The audio is mono but nicely balanced.

Give me more......,"Like many movie fans who loved Sean Connery as 007, I wasn't sure the new actor Daniel Craig would pull this off. Boy was I wrong.He is great because among other things he looks British in a nice blue eyed blond hair, WASP way, is buffed, aloof enough, and has just enough chauvinism to make 007 authentic.  But I also liked seeing the human side, like when he misreads gamblers and alas looses at the table.Anyone who knows much about either the CIA, Special Forces be it the United States or RAF, know that the men have to know not to get to attached to those they have to work with.  Craig brings this off to a 'T'.  The action is smooth and steady.  And fun!And the physical action or 'stunt work' that Craig has to do, comes off believable because he is so buffed.  Makes for a much nore realistic presentation.Judi Dench plays 'M' like a great iron lady, take no nonsense or  take no prisoners should.Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green is interesting if one listens to the dialogue and catches the devout Catholic girl remark, because in past Bond movies the women were intentionally sexual and not at all hesitant.  Was rather nice to see the suggestion that this Bond woman, wasn't so easy.  Made the romantic/sex aspect of the movie interesting and alas refreshing for me.Am really looking forward to more 007 with Daniel Craig as Bond.",0.5,4,32,6,37,0,1,1343,241,1,0.25487297789929364,0.75,79.4,117.16,0.0030114884705095607,0.3031405035755672,0.003021890837311331,0.380719841112017,0.3101062760045949,0.023827252419955324,0.0003720238095238095,4,4.5,0.0011232,0.4444444444444444,2.0,5.0,long,

What more could you want, Tom Baker and Lalla Ward perfect  chemistry as the Doctor and Romana and K9 played by John Leeson.  I have  watched State of Decay(E-space story2) so many times I have it memorized.  I first watched it when I was 8 or ten or something(when it was actually  broadcast.  Then in High school I recorded it on a low-quality VCR.  It is  still enchanting to watch.  And now I have the other two stories after a  ten year agonizing wait.  Warrior's Gate is also good and very surreal.  These are what Sci-fi stories should be.  Shows like State of Decay and  Warrior's Gate are more than just rocketships and ray guns.  Seemingly  'fantasy' elements have a science to them as well.  Tom Baker has always  tried to be involved in the scripts and it shows in all of his work.  These  are his more serious shows but they continue to have the light humor of Tom  Baker's Doctor injected into them. A good balance.  You want to be really  serious try Peter Davison, a bit too much so for my taste though.  Tom  Baker is many things in the E-Space Trilogy, not just silly like in  previous seasons.

Thaw was from my city; but I didn't know the details until I saw this film which was more than interesting.  The extremely beautiful Evelyn Nesbitt, a Broadway show girl and an original Gibson Girl whose portrait graced many a magazine cover was the spark that lit the fuse in Harry K. Thaw, causing him to murder Stanford White in the rooftop restaurant/theater of Madison Square Gardens in 1906.  After watching this film most excellently acted by Ray Miland, Joan Collins, and Farley Granger, I did my own research into those three volatile characters and found this film not far from the mark.The acting was more than decent with each character adequately developed in their own twisted way.  The story is so strange as to be nearly unbelievable but at the same time oh so true.  No writer could have imagined a story like this one and expect the audience to believe it. Rest assured the story is true. You can do your own research of the facts.

For example, the camera just focused on a camel for a couple of minutes and let you examine and admire it, as you would if you were really there. Be advised that it shows a camel have a difficult delivery, nothing too horrible but the baby gets stuck and hangs out while the mama walks around, then the humans have to pull the little bloody thing out.

But there are enough other gems in here that even if you have all the Crown films, this is still worth a purchase.This Mill creek set along with the Chilling Classics pack are considered the two best Mill Creek collections out there.

One of the best qualities of this movie is that it is unpolished. It isn't perfect stop motion animation and that is what gives it its charm. I really enjoyed The Nightmare Before Christmas ( i own it too) but the flawless stop motion took away from it, a little, for me. Sometimes imperfection IS perfection. The story here is pretty straight forward, read the synopsis and you've got it. The most memorable parts of this move, of course, are snow and heat miser. They stole the show even though they don't have much screen time over all. This movie has a child like magic and charm (with out being childish) that just isn't anywhere to be found anymore. The Christmas movies today could take a page or two from the older classic Christmas shows (fred claus was awful imo).Charming, fun, simple and full of Christmas spirit, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",1.0,0,16,4,31,0,0,978,176,1,0.26049242424242425,1.0,72.46,118.18,0.00401901053753791,0.6317745346207726,0.004079513591595467,0.004019437136803172,0.35610750411329095,0.016359918200409,0.0010214504596527069,1,,0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.0,,long,

Barnaby and Jones must look beyond superstition and family rivalries to unmask the flesh and blood person behind this apparition.Murder of Innocence : Years ago a man named Grady killed a little boy and was convicted for the crime. Now he is being released and it brings back a lot of old memories for Jones because this was his very first murder case. As soon as Grady returns to town, people responsible for this former conviction start turning up dead. Jones could be the next on the killer's hit list. But is it really Grady or did the true killer get away with murder all those years ago?Death and the Divas : A journalist was working on a biography of a pair of cult horror movie actresses. While watching one of their films, he's brutally murdered. When the film festival kicks off, more murders take place and it seems like someone is trying to turn the town into a real life horror movie.

It's a waste of a pretty decent supporting cast, including Timothy Hutton, who doesn't appear to get the kind and quality of work he deserves. There are many problems, including a silly answer to the whodunnit that you can see coming up the street way, way early.  And then, once revealed, the plot gets even worse. Most problematic, I'm afraid, is Eliza Dushku's performance. Actors talk about how hard it is to ""do crazy"" and this is as glaring an example I know of how NOT to portray a person with mental illness.  She's got all kinds of weird tics and an arm that seems to always be threatening to go Dr. Strangelove on her.  I'd diagnose any number of neurological illnesses before the schizophrenia which is supposed to be her affliction.  Her hallucinations are straight out of The Ring.

The guitarist and bassist in particular are consummate musicians -- witness their intro to 'Californication'.The only lowlight is the vocalist trying to engage with the crowd by the use of the tired vehicle &quot;Is there anyone here from County Wicklow?&quot; etc etc.Overall, a great souvenir for anyone who was there, and a great advert for anyone thinking about going to a future Chillis gig.",0.5714285714285714,3,29,4,34,1,1,1160,206,1,0.26530483405483407,1.0,69.52,33.58,0.7852030556492415,0.004530190847255677,0.2011255755581296,0.004563136762657227,0.0045780411827158534,0.025,0.0004921865386981666,1,,0.0,0.5,1.7142857142857142,,long,

The folks at DIMENSION must be pretty desperate to unload this nonsense if they have to give it away as a freebie.  Now I have to be bothered with getting this wretched, sensless, vile, waste of film out of my house because I would truly be embarrassed if anyone saw it in my home and thought that I was stupid enough to purchase it.This film represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with American Horror cinema today.  There is not a single interesting or original idea in the entire film.  How much did DIMENSION have to pay Earl Dietman of WIRELESS MAGAZINE for his cover quote ""Unlike ANY horror film you've seen before or will ever see!  The scariest movie of the year!""  Of course the film is exactly the same old boring, PG-13, CGI, desaturated nonsense that the movie-by-committee system has been throwing at us for the last four or five years.  We've all seen everything in this incoherent, ugly film OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  When will film studios get the idea that CGI digital visual effects are tired, boring and simply no longer interesting?CGI is not a substitute for IDEAS or SCARES, and of course PULSE has neither one.There is also that matter of the hideously ugly look of this film.  Every single frame from start to finish is tinted a cold blue, which is of course supposed to make the film look serious, artistic and important.  Naturally, anyone who isn't brain dead will recognize immediately that this is just a cheap gimmick to make it seem like the viewer is watching SOMETHING when instead we are really watching NOTHING AT ALL.  No ideas, no scares, no humor, no art, no likeable characters.  NOTHING  That is what this film is.  It is an abundance of nothing.Lets talk about the cast.  Suffice it to say that everyone sleepwalks through the entire film.  The entire cast as if they are on their way to a fashion magazine photo shoot, wearing clothes that would be impossible for the average American to afford.  Kristen Bell even takes a bath wearing full eye makeup (which is applied so heavily that she looks as if she has just time-warped out of a scene with Liz Taylor in CLEOPATRA).  There is nothing that could be remotely called acting going on anywhere in this botched incomprehesible mess.Sadly, it has become a safe bet that if a horror film is released in the United States by any major studio, or if the name Weinstein is associated with the film, then you will be watching an idiotic, CGI filled train wreck.  Now of course there are the occasional exceptions to that rule (DISTURBIA, CABIN FEVER, GRINDHOUSE) but in general, studio film making has sold out so bad I don't believe they even know what a real horror film looks like any more.  Too bad the folks at DIMENSION don't take a look at films being released by true independents like ASYLUM, RAPID HEART, ECHO BRIDGE etc.PULSE is certainly the worst film I've seen since SOUL SURVIVOR and in fact, it may be the worst film I've ever seen . . . EVER.  It is such an insulting, insipid, uninspired, artless heap of garbage.  A cinematic bowel movement.  Every single blue tinted, washed-out frame of it is an assault on what good film making should be.  It is really past time to simply boycott this stuff.

And this knight Nicolas Cage and his other fellow knights (one played by Ron Perlman) takes a woman accused of being a witch to a monastary to lift the Black Plauge because they believe she could be responsible. Its an alright movie to watch when it comes on t.v. one Saturday night or if you're bored and you can't find anything to watch. I liked the movie. Its not an Oscar winner or something I'd watch over and over again. Nicholas Cage's acting is hit or miss and so are his movies. There were a couple of flaws in the movie. First off since this movie is set in England so shouldn't the director think about giving Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman an English Accent? And I felt like the acting from those 2 characters could have been better or they should have picked someone else for the part. I'm not trying to put anyone off from this movie because this is one of those movies where you have to watch it see if you like it and then decide if you want to buy it or not.,0.0,0,29,5,20,1,0,1027,197,1,0.06893939393939395,0.0,87.15,66.4,0.004686354701829093,0.3638302789275913,0.004661415086906014,0.23083179232783058,0.39599015895584294,0.028237585199610515,0.0,2,1.0,0.0134784,0.0,0.0,1.0,long,

She doesn't get filled by her job as a teacher where she is respected and feared yet hated and she has no family or love life to speak of. The she spies a new art teacher, Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett): new to teaching and probably unfit to deal with the very specific needs of rowdy teenage boys and girls. Barbara decides then and there that Sheba would make a good friend and confidant: in other words someone to fill the gaping void that she calls her life.But Sheba is herself unfulfilled and needy with a difficult marriage to an older man, Richard (Bill Nighy), a Down's Syndrome son and a troubled teenage daughter on the verge of womanhood with whom Sheba has little connection.Both Sheba and Barbara are prime candidates for something different. Sheba turns to a randy fifteen year old student and Barbara turns her attentions to Sheba.Writer Patrick Marber (""Closer""), adapting a Zo Heller novel, has set up a scenario in which Barbara is the hunter and Sheba is the prey and what makes this situation particularly interesting is that Barbara's intention are not wholly, if at all, homosexual in intention. And when Barbara learns of Sheba's ill-conceived, basically stupid ""affair"" with an underage student, she uses it to control Sheba: ""I have no intention of revealing this affair"" she tells Sheba...""I just want to help you."" And so the hunter snags her prey...or so she thinks.Though Sheba's motivations are murky, Barbara's are not: she wants to control, ensnare and covet Sheba and Dench's performance is spot on: she's full of rage, she's smart, she's conniving and she is a lot crazy.""Notes on a Scandal"" is good melodrama performed to the hilt by two of our finest actresses and written and directed with wit and perception.

Martin Sheen turns in one of the finest performances of his career as Capt. Benjamin Willard, a trained special ops assassin who journeys up the Nung River to into Cambodia to terminate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando).  Kurtz has gone mad and believed to have committed atrocities outside the realm of human decency.  What sets the film apart are the memorable scenes from the film - golden nuggets of  cinematography, screenplay, and sound.  And it is precisely those elements that stand out in one of the finest transfers for Blu-ray to date.  The helicopter scene with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" blaring down on the locals, the Playboy Bunny sequence, and some of the final scenes inside Kurtz's compound are a few examples of scenes rich in detail, color, and contrast.Not only is the video portion of this Blu-ray one of the best ever, the audio will simply knock you out of your chairs.  I have SA-CDs that don't come close to sounding this good.I've had my heels nipped for mentioning the grain in other films recently released from this era.  And I see comments which basically excuse shoddy transfers from  the late seventies because ""that's the way they were shot...that's what the director intended.""  OK. Fine. Whatever.

I loved the show then and still do now.  I get to watch any episode whenever i choose and still has all the laughs, puns and the Dance of Joy that i love seeing Balki and cousin Larry perform when something great happens or when the mood strikes.  This one is packed with 28 episodes encompassing Season 1 and 2 of the show.My favorite is the two parter Snow Way To Treat a Lady.  As Larry, Balki, Jennifer get trapped in a cabin after a certain someone professes how great of a skier that he is.  But he ends up falling twisting his ankle that seems to switch legs at random moments.  They are trapped in an avalanche and the hi-jinks, crying and everything else all come out in this two part episode.  Season 2 ends with Larry's sister Elaine stopping by for a visit before she heads off to Big Apple or Pineapple as Balki likes to say.  Once Larry finds out his sis isn't going off to college he reminds her on a daily basis that she's making a huge mistake and screwing up her life.  But in the end common sense and good ole brother sister love prevail through his outdated and close minded thinking.If anything Perfect Strangers is one of those shows that i grew up with in the 80s that i still love and hold dear even after all this time.

And I must say in all aspects it stinks. Last of the Mohicans is much much very much better when it comes to story and plot and set designs. Indeed it reminds me of GODS AND GENERALS in which the lost cause was the South's Defeat in the American Civil War except it is a better film and unlike the French Candians the South had better leaders and a great deal of style. Certainly Gods and Generals is a better bit of work in all counts. But these things are History and unfortunatley there really is not much here to work with for anyone seeking to glorify the Lost Cause of New France.  Bigot was a money grubbing crooked official He's featured here). Vaudreult was the master of State Sponsored Terrorism; he payed the native warriors to slaughter english settlers women and children and all and bring him their scalps. The average French canadian's warfare was basically back shooting and terrorism alongside the savages. Except for Montcalm and his french soldiers there really was nobody worthy of honour among them.This thing has poor sets. Inferior acting. Inferior costuming. Little  in the way of plot or story to see. No Character. Would have been nice if everybody french actually spoke the language or had the accents. The english are a drab lot but the guys here aren't that colorful. This film is even worse than drab.Not worth buying.,0.6666666666666666,1,8,2,25,0,0,1432,251,1,0.09827363496718337,0.0,72.46,77.91,0.021879714489966416,0.0031048247777018434,0.0031160462253607417,0.49892871846871384,0.4729706960382573,0.00558659217877095,0.00046522447080716444,2,4.0,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,,long,

However, it isn't long before another Great White turns up to put a spoke in the wheel of family tranquility.  When this film begins, you are given the impression it's going to be good.  The title sequence has some eerily impressive camera-work, and the younger Brody brother's death scene is dramatic.  But after that, the whole thing descends into soppy, thrill-less slush.  The storyline is a total nonsense.  A shark follows Ellen Brody to the Caribbean to reek revenge for the death of its relatives, Ellen has flashbacks of her husband killing the first Jaws - funny, I don't remember her being around to witness that, and very little seems to happen for most of the film.  Michael ""I'll appear in any old twaddle for a few readies"" Caine hams it up like there's no tomorrow, characters seem to die and then magically return from the dead and the ending makes no sense whatsoever.  People complain about the special effects in Jaws 3D?  The effects here are worse.

I first saw Ninotchka four years ago and it remains one of my favourite romantic comedies of all time.Garbo wasn't known for comedy, but you wouldn't be able to tell from this film.  The marvellously witty script (co-written by Billy Wilder) certainly shines, and Ernst Lubitsch's pacing and staging are just remarkable (the &quot;door&quot; gag during the Russians' binge is priceless, akin to the elevator gag in Some Like It Hot, and the final shot is pure brilliance).  But the actors own this film.  The hilarity of Garbo's interactions with Melvyn Douglas hinges on how seriously both actors take their roles.  Without ever succumbing to the &quot;wink-wink, nudge-nudge&quot; of so many lesser comedic actors, Garbo and Douglas just let the situations and lines speak for themselves.  Garbo's straight-faced reading of her often strange lines (eg. as she types the report to Moscow regarding the three emissaries) makes for Ninotchka's best source for laughs.  And when I finally got to Ninotchka's breakthrough, I can't think of a more satisfying, or infectious, movie moment.  The loveliest laugh in the movies!My only reservation comes from the Russian stereotypes, which does verge on the broad.  However, stereotypes in comedy are common enough, and in the end, Ninotchka's treatment of its Russian characters remains good-natured, especially when the scene shifts to within Russia.  This film is one I enjoy to no end, and even after five years, it still makes me laugh for its brilliant juxtapositions, smart character situations, impeccable dialogue, and infectious high spirits.",1.0,0,57,6,69,0,1,1713,271,1,0.24805782312925173,0.0,60.24,31.55,0.002704630240425679,0.23519580988199543,0.25823810921678264,0.31934049239960566,0.1845209582611905,0.03327495621716287,0.0005834305717619603,1,,0.0,0.5,0.0,,long,

The novel single-handedly launched the fantasy genre in literature. This film should have the same effect in the cinematic realm and will elevate the fantasy movie from the depths of the cheesy ""sword and sorcery"" movies the public has known in the past. The special effects created by the team at Weta Sideshow are ground-breaking and visionary. They seamlessly create an entire fantasy world populated by primordial forests and rivers, goblins, Balrogs, giant squids, and wizards. The scope of the massive battle scene in the first five minutes of the film lets you know that this is not your typical CGI. The computer animation gives the characters gravity and presence that is lacking in most effects shots of this type. Most of the time, CGI effects are so unrealistic that the illusion is lost and one can almost imagine seeing in their minds the zaftig, over-snacked computer programmer behind their creation. Weta's creations, however, skillfully enhance the illusion in the most grand and epic way possible. They literally take your breath away.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM",0.0,1,26,5,27,0,0,1240,201,1,0.06761904761904763,0.0,61.36,100.24,0.003524012675307519,0.0035075233881986475,0.13893896122299168,0.3125790100346896,0.5414504926788125,0.020967741935483872,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.444444444444445,long,

Walking in and out of the Kettle world were their close Indian friends Geoduck and Crowbar,who were always there when Pa needed a hand,Birdie Hicks the local town snoot and know it all,smiling Billy Reed who was always there to sell you something you probably didn't need and an entire farm populated with various types of animals from goats,to dogs to chickens.The Kettles were simple,church going folks;good and honest to the core.These were wholesome films and fit for the entire family,which is one reason I say that they don't make them like this anymore.The Egg and I starred Claudette Colbert and Fred McMurray.Fred and Claudette are newlyweds and Fred has dreams of owning a farm,raising livestock and making a good living from it all.He buys  a dilapidated ""farm"" outside of Cape Flattery,Washington and starts the long,arduous process of getting things into shape while trying to kick start the farm as a money making endeavour.Claudette is a city girl born and raised and while she isn't too sure of things from the start,she loves Fred very much and tries her best to help him make a go of it.Does this plot sound familiar to you?It should as it was lifted whole sale to make Green Acres in the 60s.Claudettes patience runs thin many time throughout the film and in fact she eventually leaves Fred due to a misunderstanding involving Fred and a female neighbour,who she believes has stolen her husband right out from under her.In fact Fred(ever loyal)has bought the ladies farm while Claudette has gone off and had their first child.She returns home to find out the truth and the couple finally settle down to their new life.The film introduces the Kettles played by Marjorie Main(Ma) and Percy Kilbride(Pa)who were just incidental characters who played Fred and Claudettes neighbours.They were an instant stand out with audiences and the studio powers that be rushed out to make a film highlighting the Kettles lives.And they hit gold with seven more films.Richard Long plays their eldest son and the only one to have graduated college.And see if you can spot Spike Jones band member Earl Bennett at the dance sequence.The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle finds the family of 17(!)moving into a new home.It seems Pa has entered a tobacco sponsored contest for a new slogan.Pa only entered it for a new tobacco pouch and is disappointed when hearing he just won a house.The home is a new fangled jobby full of push buttons and futuristic gadgets.Lots of fun ensues watching the pair trying to figure out what button does what,while in the meantime Birdie Hicks finds part of Pa's slogan on some of salesman Billy Reed's flyers.Pa is charged with being a plagiarist and the home is to be returned to the tobacco company.In the end Pa is exonerated and their son Tom gets important financing for his new chicken incubator.In Ma and Pa Kettle Go To Town,Pa has won another contest.This time it's from the Bubble-Ola gum company and Pa's slogan was decided to be the favourite.Off they go to New York City to meet up with their son Tom and his wife.Before they left they unwittingly made a bank robber on the run their baby sitter for the kids while they are away.He gives them a valise(full of money) to take to NYC to give to one of his buddies there.This valise seems to have a life of its own as it gets taken by mistake and every look alike valise the Kettles buy in its place also gets switched and/or taken.The crooks in NYC seem to think the Kettles aren't as ""dumb as they look"" and are in on keeping the money for themselves.However a couple of Keystone like NYC detectives have been following the gang and in the end,with the Kettles unwitting help,they catch the thieves and the money in the proper valise.Watch the credits and you will see one of Jackie Gleasons head writers for his show,Leonard Stern.Also watch for a pre-Mr.Magoo Jim Backus in a role as one of the crooks in NYC.Finally we have Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm.Back home after their trip to NYC the Kettles don't have long to wait for things to start happening again.Tom and his wife have arrived and his wifes parents from Boston are coming to see their new grandchild.The snooty pair arrive at Ma and Pa's new home and start nitpicking at every turn.The husband eventually turns out to be a good cracker but the wife takes most of the movie to finally see the light and come around to acting decently to the Kettles.In between Pa has moved back into the old homestead and two shysters come along wanting to buy the property,thinking there is uranium on it.Tom's wifes father knows something about uranium and sends for a friend to take samples but they find nothing.It actually turns out the beeps of the Geiger counter was from some old Navy coveralls that had been exposed to radiation during one of the Pacific A-bomb tests.Ma meanwhile has been contending with her daughter in laws mother who wants the baby brought up hygienically and in pristine conditions.The two butt heads repeatedly throughout the films run and in the end the mothers husband(who usually acquiesces just to keep peace)puts her in her place and she finally apologizes for what she has done.All is forgiven and the Kettles settle back into their new home and life.Old movie director Eddie Sedgwick directed this one,who was good friends(and past director) with Buster Keaton.Also on board here is Harold Goodwin,another good friend and co-star with Buster.The nice thing about these films is that they were pretty much all inter connected,like a long running serial.They were also(except the first)about 80 minutes give or take in length;just right.They were edited well and the action and pace moved along nicely.As I said at the start the Kettles were a wholesome pair with all the good intentions the good Lord put in their hands.They somehow managed to raise 15 children, and while not in what many would consider to be in the best circumstances,they were very rich in the prime ingredient;love.All the films are full frame and have been transferred quite well as the pictures are quite crisp and clear.There are no extras.It is a pure delight to see these films back in action once more for an entirely new generation to latch onto.All in all a highly recommended treat for the entire family.",1.0,0,51,9,161,1,3,6983,1195,1,0.17106440145502644,0.0,70.02,96.18,0.14635858188004044,0.000693910473722001,0.0006891502870452752,0.6740024350701384,0.17825592228905404,0.007303451238722612,0.000143184421534937,2,4.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,,long,

""Dolls"" however, is not your average slasher horror film like ""Child's Play"". It has elements of family love and respect interwoven throught the movie in much the same way as a Grimm's Fairy Tale (to bluntly put it ""a moral""). The films starts as a young girl, her father and step mother become stranded in the middle of a forest during a storm. They seek shelter in an old, spooky house which is owned by an elderly couple who have a mass collection of dolls. They are later joined by three other people who have also been taken by suprise by the storm. When the people tuck in for the night, the dolls start to come alive and only a certain few will surive the night. The film is an imaginative blend of horror, comedy and shock which is what one would expect from the director Stuart Gordon. The special effects in dolls are very well done with plenty of stop-motion scenes to satisfy the most beloved horror fan. Stephen Lee also provides wonderful comic relief throughout the film. A must see for horror lovers who love to be scared, shocked, amused and kept in suspense throughout an entire movie.",1.0,0,16,3,33,0,0,1336,236,1,0.17789408866995074,0.0,66.57,119.19,0.0029254515844224834,0.12183094091231134,0.002913276309993125,0.34078722015664986,0.5315431110366231,0.011976047904191617,0.0007479431563201197,1,,0.0,0.9090909090909091,0.0,,long,

(Do you know anybody who saw Joe's Apartment?) It's the story of three men: Roland (Taye Diggs), Slim (Richard T. Jones) and Mike (Omar Epps), who have been friends since youth. At one point Roland, who never considered settling down EVER, had planned to marry his girlfriend, but on the big day he is nowhere to be found. As Mike and Slim search for him, they reminisce on the day they first met. Roland and Slim had already known each other, and Mike was the new guy at school. In order to fit in, he would do basically anything Roland and Slim told him, including going after Alicia, the best-looking girl in school. After going the wrong way in doing that, Alicia's gangbanging brother Stacey goes after him, but that subsides, and for some reason Mike and Alicia become friends.Back in the present, Mike and Slim finally track down Roland, who has such cold feet that he is now drunk out of his mind. After he gets cleaned up, the three of them go shopping, which spurs another memory: when they were at the school dance. Roland and Slim made up a contest for who could get the most girls' phone numbers. Mike went along with it unenthusiastically, for the only girl he was interested in was Alicia. He did end up getting her number, and her number alone. Although Roland and Slim ended up getting several girls' numbers, they both agreed that Mike's one number was bigger than all their numbers combined.Later on they hold another contest...for who can lose their virginity first. Roland and Slim lost theirs with no trouble. Mike lost his as well, to Alicia, but he didn't tell them about it because he decided it was more important than a contest.This movie was good, but there were a few things wrong with it. Roland was the former womanizer, and Roland was the guy getting married. So why did all the flashbacks revolve around Mike? Also, we know Roland was drunk, but the regurgitation scene was a little too graphic. He was throwing up nonstop for a full minute. Still, this is one of the better black movies I've seen. Just don't compare it to Soul Food or Love &amp; Basketball.",0.5,3,39,8,77,2,0,2143,384,1,0.04400252525252526,0.5,81.83,114.12,0.0021251333734670606,0.002105766748199092,0.0020970058160335,0.6642118008719952,0.3294602931903053,0.018198786747550162,0.0002332089552238806,1,,0.0,0.42857142857142855,1.5,,long,

1471624,B005LAIHPE,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,1,1,1970-01-01 00:00:01.364428800,A great naval action film brought down by cringe-inducing everything else,"Battleship is a movie about huge boats with tons of guns blasting the absolute stuffing out of each other. Some of the boats are from space and as a result look all cool and science-fiction-ey, albeit in a somewhat generic way. The alien invaders' ships have a technological edge on Earth's navy, but both fleets are able to deal fairly significant damage to one another. The result is a lot of epic, loud naval combat which is more than a little reminiscent of Japanese nautical adventure comics. Is it then a coincidence that this movie has a prominent Japanese principal (Tadanobu Asano) and premiered in Japan? Surely not. But that's by no means a bad thing- strong foreign cast members and badass naval combat are far too lacking in modern American cinema.The effects for the sea battles are extremely good, and the alien enemies themselves, though rather as generic as their boats, stand out as a high point- they are neither as wantonly evil and bestial as science fiction invaders tend to be, nor as grossly overpowered. When one of their number is captured, they rescue him(?) in a commando raid, and they depend on stealth, sabotage, and cunning to a degree that is usually reserved for the wily human underdogs in such films. Compared to the forgettable Wing Commander movie, in which the noble and cunning Kilrathi were reduced to snarling beast-men with Wolverine claws, the aliens in Battleship are interesting and exciting. They also serve as a warning against dependance on technology over judgment in wartime: most of their blunders result from an over-reliance on friend-or-foe systems in their helmets that allow human combatants to escape certain doom by standing down. This message about brains over science is also played out among the humans themselves- the navy doesn't really clean house until they abandon their modern but technologically vulnerable ships in favor of a thousand tons of antique, cannon-toting battleship (the name has to come in somewhere, right?).So the battleship part of Battleship is a 4 or 5 star film. But it gets dragged down by its opening 30 minutes. These are not exciting, alien battling, swashbuckling, exploding minutes- they are framing in which we learn how our protagonist Taylor Kitsche is a super irresponsible guy who will rob a convenience store to impress a girl (it works). Kitche's character somehow makes second lieutenant in about a year in spite of angering admiral Liam Neeson and constantly disappointing his brother Alexander Skarsgrd, who cannot be bothered to suppress his Swedish accent even when he is playing an all-American military man. This misguided block of exposition is punctuated by irritating editing, poorly selected musical scoring, and an uncanny resemblance to a Red Skelton USO sketch, which I must assume is deliberate, and by extension, a horrible idea. You will have to fight hard to keep watching by the 10 minute mark, and when the aliens finally show up to explode stuff, they sort of feel like the heroes.Pros:-Great effects-Surprisingly plausible interstellar war-Enough sprays of missiles, explosions, and churning engines to please the most jaded anime nerd or dieselpunk aficionadoCons:-Horrible characterization-Awful music choices (the end credits employ CCR's Fortunate Son, which I'm pretty sure is a song about how hard it sucks to be in the military and get ordered around by money men and pencil pushers, and is an odd choice in a film where the heroes fight an unavoidable, self-directed war against a totally clean hostile target)-Odd conclusion (with the alien fleet beaten, EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES EARTH IS SAFE IMMEDIATELY (of course there's a post-credit scene to remind us it totally isn't)Conclusion:Better than any film based on a board game has a right to be, Battleship only hits its mark when the shells are flying, and as a result is an entertaining film but not a very good one.",1.0,0,73,11,101,3,0,3899,641,1,0.019450745123822062,0.24814814814814815,45.73,68.77,0.001367479132523254,0.001353778299400617,0.1530442586256841,0.4353576707356172,0.4088768132067749,0.018722749422928956,0.0002564102564102564,1,,0.0,0.5,0.0,4.5,long,

With ""Empire Of The Sun"", Steven Spielberg built the foundations for his best movie to date ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg took the strongest points in ""Empire Of The Sun"",  for example: excellent music, outstanding cinematography, great set designs, remarkable performances (Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson), so it's fair to say that ""Empire Of The Sun"" gave to Spielberg a lot of experience for subsequent productions.Usually in Spielberg's movies, child actors play a significant role in the plot (""E.T."", ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""Hook""), and ""Empire Of The Sun"" is not an exception. Christian Bale is the young actor who plays the lead role in the film: Jamie, a corky, inopportune kid that snoops around everywhere getting him into trouble. As the film moves along, Jamie gets more experience, bravery  and intelligence, an excellent performance by Christian Bale I must say (perhaps his best yet).Other actors shine in ""Empire Of The Sun"", John Malkovich is the standout, although there are other big names like Joe Pantoliano and Miranda Richardson (Ben Stiller appears briefly). Definitely the film is a survivor's story, and becomes more relevant when the survivor happens to be a little kid that lost his parents and his former lifestyle.",0.46153846153846156,7,47,8,72,0,0,1361,213,1,0.3120192307692307,0.0,53.04,71.82,0.003040140191536141,0.2528288016430201,0.0029928030800126506,0.7381127533443591,0.003025501741072171,0.034533431300514325,0.00033886818027787193,1,,0.0,0.42857142857142855,3.230769230769231,5.0,long,

It was mainly the subject matter which intrigued me. I like films exploring outsiders, intergenerational ethnic dramas and of course the ultimate outsider; the gay man from a conservative culture trying to battle his family, roots and a modern lifestyle. This film was some attempt to address these non main-stream issues. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark. Some of the same issues were addressed in Hamam (Turkish/Italian) and particularly well in Sasha (Balkan/German).The film comes with an 18 rating which is nonsense. There is a little mild nudity perhaps and no sex scenes - nothing you wouldn't see on day time TV anyway. There is some graphic violence but that is nothing more than you would encounter on an evening soap. Maybe the film company wanted the 18 cert to boost sales. Either way it isn't warranted. Because the film is to be marketed in the Middle East it is assumed by the reviewer here that the love scenes were merely superficial (more implied than shown) in order not to offend potential viewers and their values. I would have thought that merely watching the film in the first place would have implied that they had no intention of being offended.The storyline is good. Modern Belgian man from traditional Turkish stock is manipulated into marrying a cousin from some backwater in Turkey. They supposedly know nothing of his leanings although the mother suspects but would ignore it as long as he married and produced children. The father sees his oldest son as an extension of himself and the person to carry on the family values. The ironic thing is that both parents were born in Europe, not Turkey, but still closely identify with the Motherland as it were. They became more Turkish than the Turks - very similar to the Irish in the US embracing everything they believed to be `Irish' no matter how cliched.The second son is the centre of the sub plot although you could be forgiven if you believed it was the other way round. Furkan represents all the bad sides of ghettoization and displacement. He was born in Belgium but sees himself as an outsider and even has no feelings for his Turkish identity opting to join an Islamic Fundamentalist mosque when relations with his father deteriorate too far. For those of us who know nothing of the sense of displacement North African and Middle Eastern emigrants the story in a story is done quite well - even if the acting is a bit strained. I'm assuming some of the radicals are inexperienced actors or not actors at all. Personally I think this subplot could have been the subject of a film in itself and may have taken too much from the developing relationship between Bram and Kevin. Kevin, the young Belgian man seems a bit out of his depth and his acting in the Hamam scene shows this. I couldn't see much of a spark between the two of them anyway.As contrasted with Sasha, there is little culture in this film. It is just basic suburban living with little to lift the spirit - even suburbanites are not cultural vacuums. There is little music in it and a more judicious use of selected Turkish pieces I found would have heightened the sense of drama or tenderness. The music was saved for the violence. The director isn't Turkish of course so there may be some gaps there because of that. Also I couldn't see why the blandness of the Belgian city was replicated in the blandness of the Turkish town. We were told by Kevin how beautiful Turkey was but there is practically no scenery, an empty hotel of dubious quality and the people leave a lot to be desired yet any superficial visitor to the country would know that Turkey has some of the most dramatic coastlines in the world. None of it was used.There is no humour in it either - I don't know if that is the Belgian side coming out! Even a few light hearted scenes or even an odd character would have lightened the load a bit, but nothing. I don't know how a relationship like this could survive without humour as they are doomed to failure by all around them but Kevin isn't presented as a developed character and we get the impression that there is no background there, no hobbies or interests. And no fun either.It is a film worth watching because of its uniqueness. Films covering these topics are few and far between but I feel an opportunity was lost here. The Turks have a long history of film production so there is no excuse and it is a pity that a European director had to try fill in the gap. I would recommend watching it but don't get too excited nor pay too much.",0.0,0,20,3,81,0,1,4615,827,1,0.04507042253521128,0.0,69.01,9.21,0.0011528985185176753,0.001154695760186052,0.001148880536733726,0.6537183687873411,0.3428251563972214,0.004333694474539545,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

This movie steers away from these types of unsubtle, ""slap you with a fish"" type of comedies that Ben Stiller is a master of.While at times Wedding Crashers does have that kind of humor, it feels like it's more underlying and sporadic.  It's the kind of movie where you laugh because the characters find themselves in extremely bizarre and hilarious situations, but it's subtle.  Unlike these other comedies, Wedding Crashers wants you to have a good time and laugh, but it doesn't force you to, most of the time they don't TRY to be funny, they just are.  You can tell they want you to laugh WITH them, and not AT them.I just really loved this movie, not only because it was hilarious, but also because of the love story that goes along with it.  It doesn't feel too pushed or ""blah"", in part because while it's essential to the story, it's not the center of it, it's like milk or cream in your coffee, it sweetens the pot.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are great, they have great chemistry and you just want everything to work out for them, they really make you sympathise for them, which is great, it gives the whole movie a little more ""humane"" feel to it.  And Rachel McAdams fantastic, you just fall in love with her as well.  The actress who plays her sister is also extremely hilarious.This movie is great, it's one that you can watch over a 100 times and still laugh every time, thanks to a hilarious yet romantic story and a great cast.

Indeed, the film is so good-natured that it's a surprise to find mention of 'n**-n**s' in the script (this was 1962, after all).With a great cast filled with familiar faces, the undisputed star of the show is Wilbur the carrier pigeon and his unique way of delivering messages!",1.0,0,19,4,43,0,1,1316,211,1,0.24354876893939392,0.525,44.21,75.88,0.006006467297830296,0.1776948951339968,0.006035669332931384,0.8042328945155256,0.006030073719715783,0.014437689969604863,0.0007593014426727411,7,3.0,0.0050976,0.5,0.0,,long,

It wasn't great, that's for sure, but good.  It was kind of campy and silly, but it was fun.  The beginning sequences let us know that this wasn't going to be the same Superman movies we were used to with the chain reaction of funny accidents on the street.  It made you smile.

No, I can't forgive that one because that was pretty bad.  Too obvious.I think what turned people off from this movie was the fact that it went another direction from the previous Superman movies where he was taken out of Metropolis, dealing with other villans than Lex Luthor, and having another love interest besides Lois Lane (apparently Margo Kidder was off her meds and had her part cut for her bad behavior).

I rented both of these movies and glad I did--only to find out if I purchased the $19.00 on either I would have been very angry--I would have felt extremely cheated. I definitely felt both were not good movies.""Deader"" has a few good moments, but I'm not saying it's entirely bad...but not terribly good either. I would say it'sso-so.

It really is a very cheap--and boring--trick to allegedly hold your attention.

The performances of Winger and Russell are captivating, as well as those of the relatively minor characters. The setting and the dialogue also add to a flawless piece of work.Synopsis: Winger, an ambitious federal agent, doing paperwork on a Mafia boss' death, and sick of her desk job, becomes intrigued with Ondine's Curse, a painless, nonviolent, death that occurs when sleeping. She then stumbles on a couple of similar cases where the now-wealthy widow suddenly disappears afterwards. She follows up several leads. One of them goes to Seattle, where she meets a potential victim, a good, shy, and kind wealthy newly married anthropologist. He dies soon thereafter and Winger blames herself for his death. She then follows the black widow to Hawaii to her next victim. The rest I leave up to the viewer in order not to spoil the movie further.Both women are portrayed as being very intelligent and driven. Winger is at first obsessed with leaving her desk job and later in catching the black widow. Russell is a master (mistress?) manipulator (who could have been a chess champion), but who nonetheless is ""cracked.""

To me fantasy means something that does not exist or has not been proven to exist in our world. I'm not sure that this movie qualifies at all.

Some villages are under attack from a mysterious race of creatures called the Wendol, which seem to be half-human, half-bear. They quickly turn out to be just a tribe of cannibalistic cave-dwelling savages who wear bear skins to terrify and confuse their victims.The movie stars Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab who was exiled from his homeland and meets up with a group of vikings lead by Buliwyf. Then they spend the rest of the movie fighting the Wendol, one battle after another. Some of them die, some of them survive but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. Ahmad ibn Fadlan was a real person who lived in the 10th century AD. This doesn't make the story any more interesting and just further dilutes fantasy aspect.

Also, let me say that I'm not a submariner, but I did attend two dependents day cruises on the USS Menhaden (377) in 1956 and 57 as I recall.I found this movie to be true to life in terms of the set.  To me, it looks as if they filmed the entire thing inside a real Gato class sub.  Robert Wise even managed to convey the feeling of claustrophobia the crews used to feel.  Every detail seems to have been considered.Clark Gable does a wonderful job in his role as the Captain and Burt Lancaster is very beliveable as Mr. Bledsoe the executive officer.  Don Rickles is a integral part of the cast and you can see the beginnings of his patented mister nasty personna.The plot is pretty straightforward.  Gables character loses a submarine in the Bongo Straights, an area off the coast of Japan.  He survives this incident, and for the next year commands a desk at Pearl.  Only after a fourth sub is lost in the infamous Area 7 (Bongo Straights), does he worm his way back into command.  The command he manages to get is the Nerka, a boat to be commanded by Burt Lancasters character, Mr. Bledsoe.  Much of the movie deals with the tension between Captain and Exec because of this.Eventually, the mystery of Area 7, the Bongo Straights is solved, but not without the loss of a leading character.I've seen other reviewers critize this movie because of the less then stellar special effects.

It rivals that of ""The Amityville Horror.""  Wonderful direction is given by Dan Curtis who is a master of modern gothic horror.  He directed numerous television horror hits such as ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Night Stalker.""  The later spawned a television series of the same title and greatly influenced ""The X-Files.""  He is most famous for his gothic daytime soap opera, ""Dark Shadows,"" of which I was a devoted fan.This masterpiece of modern gothic horror has a great all star cast that includes Karen Black (""Trilogy of Terror""), Oliver Reed (Hammer Film Production's ""Curse of the Werewolf""), Lee Montgomery (""Ben""), Bette Davis (""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?""), and Burgess Meredith (Amicus Production's ""Torture Garden"").  Ben and Marian Rolf (Reed and Black), their son Davey (Montgomery), and Aunt Elizabeth (Davis) move into a sprawling, dilapidated mansion for the summer.  Mysterious accidents plague the family.  Each time blood is shed, the house is rejuvenated, becoming stronger, more malevolent.  Soon it becomes apparent that the house has a life of its own and has no intention of letting any of them leave alive.A creepy atmosphere pervades this chiller.  Especially notable are the terrifying visions that Ben has of the chauffeur that was at his mother's funeral.  The man was positively frightening with his gaunt, cadaver-like facial features and malevolent smile.  I found this film much more terrifying and disturbing than ""The Amityville Horror.""  The ending was quite shocking and downbeat.  It reminded me much of Dan Curtis' ""Night of Dark Shadows"" when Tracy Collins screams hysterically upon realizing the hopelessness of her situation.""Burnt Offerings"" is highly recommended for those who love good old-fashioned stories of ghosts and haunted houses.  It is for those who love their horror subtle and suspenseful.  You will be required to use your imagination because not everything is explained.

To my memory, some of the best portrayals of cops on the silver screen come from films such as ""Serpico,"" ""The French Connection,"" ""The Prince of the City,"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" or even minor films such as ""Q & A"" and ""Year of the Dragon."" My ""favorite"" movie cops, so to speak, tend to be the ones on the edge of the law, or the force, or both.There was a fair amount of pre-release print devoted to this film, so of course I had very high expectations of Denzel Washington's character, who's an L.A. street detective always ""on the dark side of the force."" The parallels between Washington's Alonzo Harris and the real-life Rafael Perez (the LAPD detective notorious for his role in the Rampart scandal) are obvious. But what's most interesting about this comparison is the fact that David Ayer's searing screenplay was essentially completed long before Rampart became a synonym for police corruption. This is not just a story imitating history, but reflecting it directly. Ayer drops you headlong into the gutter to smell, breathe, and taste the world that ""Training Day"" brings, the blurred line between good and evil. Along with Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction and Mark Mancina's ominous score, this film doesn't just show you the streets ... it is the streets.The story introduces Alonzo in the most effective way possible ... by using Ethan Hawke's character Jake Hoyt as his ""straight man"" (and our moral center), so that as we are bombarded by Alonzo's extremely unconventional methods, Jake's reactions are also ours. In scene after scene, Alonzo's lesson is that in order to get crime off the streets, you first have to get close enough to it to make you a little dirty. Not surprisingly, Washington dominates the screen in every single scene, with language and behavior unlike most of the movie cops portrayed before him. Washington invests the character with one part depth, one part smarts, and two parts swagger, with a street-level expertise that is alternately impressive and repulsive.I was somewhat let down by the final 20 minutes, because Alonzo is suddenly made into an irredeemable villain, which cheapens the character, and we are supposed to accept what becomes of him at face value. Such a giftwrapped ending is in keeping more with Hollywood's peculiar white hat/black hat moral tradition rather than the harsh realities preached by Alonzo throughout the film. It looks like an ending decided in the production office rather than on the keyboard. A more ambiguous ending would have been more explosive in its own way, and I suppose that's why the break is so clean.Denzel Washington's second Oscar is well deserved. Alonzo Harris is one of the most unforgettable movie cops I've ever seen. The moral here, if there is one, is that even a blurred line can be crossed.",0.6666666666666666,1,34,7,109,0,0,2887,486,1,0.17588807904114026,0.0,59.53,115.13,0.01967892977708443,0.0018008598651486597,0.0017961596878584016,0.7051398157739026,0.27158423489600586,0.011776931070315206,0.00023084025854108956,1,,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,4.0,long,

Besides releasing albums at an astoundingly fast pace, he released dozens of singles with non-lp B-sides, plus all sorts of rarities that were specifically tailored to whet the appetite of obsessive fans. Most of this stuff eventually found its way to various compilations, and the obsessive edge faded away as Elvis moved away from `alternative new wave' and toward a much more varied musical career. ""The Right Spectacle"" summarizes the videos from the `collectible' age of Elvis Costello's career, and it is mind-boggling to consider what this collection might have been worth to obsessive Costello fanatics twenty-five years ago.To be sure, the production quality is absolutely dreadful for many of these videos, especially early entries like ""Pump It Up"", ""Radio Radio"" and ""Oliver's Army"". Luckily, the cheesy factor is half of the fun. The other half of the fun is provided by Elvis' commentary track, which is simply essential for viewing this collection. His own contemporary perspective can be hilarious, and it's great to hear the artist put his career in perspective with an authority that is his alone. The ""special features' of this collection are perhaps even more relevant than the videos, consisting of seven different appearances on European television. My only complaint is that Elvis' commentary track does not extend to the live appearances.Back in the day, I knew people who would spend a week's pay to obtain a rare Elvis Costello disk. Hell, I was one of those people. Back then, it was unthinkable that I might one day be able to obtain nearly thirty videos and over a half-dozen rare television appearances, all for the cost of an import LP. Good things come to those who wait, so if (unlike me) you saved your money back then, here is your opportunity to catch up on some entertaining musical history.A-  Tom Ryan",1.0,0,19,3,61,0,0,1926,320,1,0.15223439754689755,0.0,58.32,59.97,0.9892781684336743,0.002686125911732872,0.0026937102916330265,0.0026677843484424093,0.0026742110145174976,0.009865005192107996,0.0005189413596263622,2,5.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,,long,

Centuries ago, knights and their attendants would work with their enemies to clear a field for combat the next day. Such cooperation had an obvious practical value. That's not what interests Weintraub as he examines a temporary truce during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It had little (if any) practical or tactical value but it did (and does) suggest a human need which transcends military obligations. However, war is war. After a brief respite, the carnage inevitably resumes.A Midnight Clear was directed by Keith Gordon and is based on William Wharton's autobiographical novel. Rather than featuring a star such as Burt Lancaster (as in Castle Keep), the lead roles in this film are played by those normally seen in supporting roles. For example, Kevin Dillon, Ethan Hawke, and Gary Sinise. They and all others in the cast are first-rate. Basically, here's the situation. An elite U.S. Army intelligence unit is given a reconnaissance mission in the Ardennes Forest in December of 1944, just before the Battle of the Bulge. The men in the platoon may be far from home as Christmas approaches, lonely and miserably cold, but they retain a certain playful spirit comparable with what Robert Altman celebrates in M.A.S.H. They encounter a German unit and then....While seeing this film the first time and then again recently, I felt as if I were dreaming that I had returned to the 1940s in a time machine, to Belgium near the end of World War Two. Credit Tom Richmond's cinematography with creating an uncommonly beautiful setting for the savage combat which occurs there, as does John Mathieson during the ""Hell Unleashed"" sequence early in Gladiator. The dreamlike atmosphere continues throughout as the men suspend and then resume their own involvement in the war. This is a haunting film, at times an exquisitely lovely film, but also one which raises some serious questions. Why not throw snow balls instead of grenades, then treat each other to a round of drinks? Why not celebrate Christmas together, exchanging gifts and singing carols, as their ancestors once did on Christmas Eve in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders? Doesn't all that make much more sense than killing each other? Of course. It's just that....",0.9583333333333334,3,47,7,75,3,0,2577,425,1,0.06956453634085212,-0.2,61.97,30.53,0.0021748833055585787,0.12208221118395705,0.0021712198312739094,0.8713852988212085,0.0021863868580018655,0.01823826154443151,0.0003717351952417895,6,4.8,0.0003456,0.9452054794520548,2.875,,long,

Jennifer Jason Leigh ,Aitana Sanchez Gijon, Michael Ironside ,and John Sherian provide  the perfect supporting cast. However the dedication of Christian Bale , to his character (Trevor Reznik) , transports this simple film , to cult classic status. As with the other reviews , I'll reintereate that Bale's performance was outstanding , by simply underplaying his character. His brilliant performance is also highlighted by his appearance. I've seen alot of movies. However , I've never seen any actor go through such a physical transformation. It took atleast 30 min. to get over the fact that Bale lost so much weight for this film. After that initial distraction , the film took on unexpected hieghts and emotional depths , that I'm sure I'll remember for years. This is a definate film , for Bale fans , to watch.

I was pumped for number 2 and actually enjoyed it quite a bit, I thought were climbing a hill of movie goodness here.  Saw III followed and was interesting to say the least, I was happy it improved over on the 1st and 2nd and kept me interested in 4.  Needless to say  4 and 5 plummeted the series like a skydive gone wrong...I was officially done with Saw after seeing 5.Last week I fell to the curiosity of Saw 6 and decided to see it that weekend.  I went into the theater with my 6 dollar soda, and 5 dollar skittles, sat through the 4 or so teenagers next to me giggling and talking through the entire 91 minute movie...then came the end credits.I can honestly say after all was said and done my friends and I looked at each other with ear to ear grins.  I was very happy with this 6th installment, and didn't feel so bad about the 20+ dollars I had spent to see this movie.  The opening scene is brutal and has you sitting back in your seat thinking OUCH!  The movie throws in some real world situations that most people can relate to or at least see the truth in.In my mind a lot of things were answered and blanks filled in from the last couple movies, which I felt helped number 6 a lot.  And the new director didn't clam up and make this one borderline PG-13, the gore is very well done and makes even me, a horror fanatic cringe.  I'm not gonna discuss the plot, or twists, because I think you should feel how I did when they play out on screen.I will say when it comes to Saw 6, forgive and forget the last 2 and see this one!  If your a Saw fan your gonna love this new installment, if you were a Saw fan this will re-ignite your Saw fascination, and at least get your heart pumping and mind racing as to what the next installment will include!  I can honestly say I'm looking forward to adding this to my Blu Ray collection and think it will shine next to the abomination that was Saw 4 & 5.",0.8846153846153846,6,24,3,44,0,3,2009,389,1,0.09602272727272729,0.0,74.93,59.97,0.11311530490936483,0.07029313208690563,0.06808469228969295,0.0020044190592894756,0.7465024516547472,0.011946241911398706,0.00044010715652506696,1,,0.0,0.8679245283018868,5.3076923076923075,,long,

Director Stanley Kwan has made an intelligent film that conveys genuine emotion without theatricality. There is much that rings true in this story for gay men, or anyone, of any age. Based on an incredibly popular 'E-novel' from an anonymous author, Jimmy Ngai's screenplay strikes many true chords and, along with a well-realized mise-en-scene, creates a completely believeable world.Casting seems ideal. Thirty-something Hangdong is played with great range by Jun Hu, and he looks convincing in the part as well. Playing Lan Yu, who ages from late teens into twenties, is remarkable Ye Liu. The men meet as part of a transaction: money for sex, paid by wealthy Hangdong. The sex scenes are presented with honesty, sensuality and without ambiguity. Yet, early on, it becomes clear to both that more is going on than physicality. For a short time, they pursue a relationship. Then everything is altered by choices made by one of the men. The main part of the film, told as a memory, is the playing out of the consequences of his choice. If these characters were heterosexual, the film's plot might be dismissed as hackneyed. But with the added dynamic of male/male relations in a homophobic world and with Kwan's dream-like, often poetic directing style, we have something ultimately original and worth experiencing.The film is presented letterboxed on the DVD and it looks very good. The often rich textures of the image come across beautifully. Also on the disc: a video interview with the director and four trailers for other gay-interest films.LAN YU has real emotional impact and sensuality. It deserves a wide audience.",0.96875,1,26,5,56,0,0,1756,289,1,0.3365686274509804,0.0,56.76,83.32,0.1618306969030156,0.0025821268808693754,0.002575814075916068,0.8304177483034629,0.0025936138367361524,0.014806378132118452,0.0005513659647125782,3,2.0,0.0533088,0.9393939393939394,0.96875,,long,

Not for Karloff fans only, TARGETS is a uniquely suspensful film that combines a serial killer narrative with that of the final career stage of an aging king of horror films. What may be surprising is that it works. It works very well. Peter Bogdanovich demonstrates plenty of assurance and resourcefulness in this project that may have defeated a less adventurous director. There are no dull moments in TARGETS and the viewer continually marvels at the ingenuity of Bogdanovich, the cinematographer, and the sound technicians (this is one of the first studio-supported films that does not use a soundtrack, rather it uses source music only).Karloff is in very good form here, delivering a subtle, humorous, self-deprecating portrayal that will not soon be forgotten by anyone who sees it. It is a worthy swan song for the great horror icon.TARGETS looks downright incredible on DVD. Presented in widescreen, the nearly flawless image quality betrays almost nothing of the film's age. There is a short documentary on the making of the film, which includes portions of the trailer (which is itself not included as a supplement on the disc). The director makes many points that are repeated in the feature-length commentary. Bogdanovich's commentaries are among the better examples of their kind: he explains a lot about how shots were achieved, but he also gives plenty of credit for inspiration from older film makers--like Sam Fuller, Orson Welles, Hitchcock, John Ford, and Roger Corman--and he seems to have an endless collection of interesting anecdotes about the movie business.Don't pass up this fantastic DVD.",1.0,0,41,7,43,0,0,1726,280,1,0.3467528735632184,-0.6,59.64,106.67,0.5092387985658111,0.0024712397479001004,0.002449146879290935,0.44427593397434134,0.04156488083265646,0.023754345307068367,0.0005790387955993051,3,2.0,0.0081216,0.8888888888888888,0.0,,long,

Some of these are uneven at best, Martin & Lewis were still trying to figure what translated well to the screen, this included the writers too. When it comes to Jerry Lewis you love him or you hate him. Personally, I liked him more when I was younger, his antics & mugging are a little harder to take as an adult.You can see their progression as actors as the set moves into their career. By the time you get to the last film of this set they have improved immensely, becoming actors, even.My Friend Irma***This is a loose translation of a radio program in which Martin & lewis were inserted. Certainly, they aren't the stars but they make an incredible impact in their debut. In this one Martin is trying to become a nightclub singer (really?) & is managed by Irma's boyfriend. Lewis is an inept employee of an orange juice establishment. It's pretty thin stuff. Lewis dominates the scenes with his over-the-top antics. Martin is more than adequate as an actor.My Friend Irma Goes West***By the time this sequel was made Martin & Lewis were the stars & the whole original premise of the radio show becomes secondary or is scrapped. It is interesting to see Las Vegas so young in its life yet to have all of its bright lights. Martin is going west assuming he has been awarded a movie contract & the other characters are along for the Lewis rollercoaster. Even with only his second film Lewis is already polarizing the audience: They think he's the biggest fool or the gretest comedian ever.Sailor Beware***This was the team's first true starring vehicle. It's somewhat of an improvement but by now the Martin & Lewis characters are set. Martin is the smooth ladies' man & crooner, Lewis is inept, shy, sickly & sometimes allergic to women. Corinne Calvet makes an appearance as an ice queen that no man can get at. Highlight of the film is Lewis preparing for his boxing match. The routine in the locker room is hilarious as is the scene when they get in the ring. Truly classic.That's My Boy**There's so little that's believable in this film it's a near waste of time. Eddie Mayehoff ii his screen debut is nothing short of a ham. His character is nothing more than a caricature. Martin & Lewis are unbelievable as high school graduates about to enter college, none of it rings true. Once again Lewis walks off with the highlights as he becomes the hero by winning a football game.Jumping Jacks****By this time Martin & Lewis are becoming actors. The service comedy routine had already gone well twice with the team so a third one was done. Martin & Lewis have become paratroopers which is a great setup for Lewis: How much funnier can it get when a man can't even fold his own parachute when his life is at stake?The Stooge****This film actually gives the team a script where they prove their acting mettle. Martin wants to make it on his own as a singer but he's too vanilla without a comedic partner. He ditches one to go to solo but he bombs. He's then teamed up with Lewis & they become a sensation. Martin doesn't want to give Lewis credit in the team or their success nor does he believe Lewis is the reason he's successful. The Stooge allows the team to be more themselves & has some quality moments.Scared Stiff***This film is a remake of Bob Hope's The Ghostbreakers. It's not just a remake, it's almost the same film. The only difference is the Martin & Lewis parts are, essentially, the Bob Hope character split into two parts. It's a good vehicle for the team.The Caddy****This film along with Jumping Jacks are the highlights of this set. Lewis is the son of a golfing great & has great potential himself except he can't play in front of people. Martin is the son of a fisherman but gets seasick. Lewis is engaged to Martin's sister though Martin & Lewis haven't met one another yet. Lewis is, of course, inept as a department store employee & has a scene where he wreaks havoc in the store. Then Lewis gets the idea of starting a golf instruction school. Martin becomes his protegee & they have immediate success. Golf greats have cameos in the film. This role for Lewis is actually the most mature of his roles in this set. This is also the film that Features the song ""That's Amore"".This set has good value & is great for Lewis fans.",1.0,0,33,6,152,2,0,4338,780,1,0.21654736467236468,0.0,74.19,66.4,0.1280170029663666,0.0011425568668222254,0.0011304754712159971,0.7934030879200695,0.07630687677552571,0.007607192254495159,0.00023046784973496196,1,,0.0,0.8,0.0,,long,

I've been a fan of the show since I saw the first episode and during the last season I was quite busy with work and wasn't able to enjoy the final season of one of my favorite TV shows of recent years.  While bigger shows (that I also enjoyed such as Lost and 24) may have gotten bigger fanfare in their exits from the small screen, I think Betty's final bow was as poignant and touching as any finale I've seen.I was saddened to hear that the show was ending but perhaps it was the right time for the show.  The last season ended on a high note.  They tied up some loose ends, allowed us to see some of Betty's old flames (Henry and Gio) and allowed Hilda to finally find true love (with CSI Miami's Adam Rodriquez).  Rather than rely on huge stars to pepper the final season (like Shakira, who was in an episode) they instead gave us the things that we've come to love about Ugly Betty---the great Wilomena one liners, the crazy antics of Marc and Amanda, the dedication of the Suarez family and the true spirit of Betty. What most of us loved about Betty was her determination to succeed and her belief in her dreams; something I think most of us can relate to.  While along there way there was lots of outlandish comic soap opera-esque moments, there were also scenes and storylines that were well done and life affirming. The storyline with Justin and his coming out were very sweet and sent a positive message to gay teenagers who may be struggling with the same questions and worries in their own lives.  And the Suarez clan's support and love for their gay teenager is an example as well to family members who find that they have a gay teen or family member.  One of the most memomorable scenes of the final 4 or 5 episodes has Justin coming out to his family by dancing with his boyfriend at his mom's wedding.  Its a subtle, lovely scene that is one of the best of the entire series.  It was also great to see a show that gave voice to the latin community and presented latinos in the limelight for a change.I'll miss the wicked schemes of Wilomena, portrayed to a tee by the talented Vanessa Williams, Marc and Amanda's unyielding catty remarks and the charm of America Ferrera, for whom without the series would have never been a success.  Her turn as Betty was someone who we could all identify with and root for and her gradual transformation revealed the beauty of the woman inside.  Betty never gave up on her goals or herself and made the choices that were right for her, a positive role model for young women.  She may have become more aware of fashion but she never abandoned who she truly was.I'll definitely add this final season to my dvd collection.  I'm glad we got to know Betty.....and I'm glad that at the end of the show, they dropped the ""ugly"" from the title as the final scene faded to black.  Betty may not have been a fashionista to begin with but she was beautiful on the inside.

At a very minimum, the film setup leaves you expecting a clever narrative device.  This would, at least, have distinguished the film from the thousands of other movies that go directly to DVD.  But any cleverness is soon forgotten in this blustery, overacted piece of nonsense.  Too serious to be real ""dumb"" fun, too ridiculous to be taken as a straight thriller, and too silly to be seen as a media savvy satire--there really isn't much that works in ""American Crime.""  It's a bit of a shame, too.  With this cast and concept, a more focused screenplay and tighter direction could have made an effective little picture.I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of ""American Crime.""  Shot in the documentary style of ""true crime"" TV expose shows, the film tracks a possible serial killer.  Seeing the film footage being reported on an actual TV program is a great idea and an interesting approach, you are lured into thinking that the film might really have a novel point of view.  However, we soon step away from this concept and into ""real life"" scenarios.  What is interesting, though, is that these scenes are also being filmed by characters within them.  This movie, then, might have been unique had all the footage used been shot from a camera within the story (ALA the clever filmic technique of ""The Blair Witch Project"").  This seems to have been too much work, too, and any notions of the interesting narrative device enhancing the story are abandoned when regular camerawork soon takes over everything.The story itself is a rather overheated bit of fluff.  Rachael Leigh Cook, Kip Pardue and Annabella Sciorra play a local TV news crew on the track of a big story--a serial killer no one believes is real.  Battling ineffective law enforcement and each other, they start to attract the attention of the killer.  Cook becomes so freaked out that she may be targeted, she promptly abandons her job and life and moves away.  In steps Cary Elwes as an ""American Crime"" correspondent to cover the story for national broadcast.  Playing somewhat comically (which may or may not be intentional), these three spend the rest of the film seeking the truth and possibly putting themselves into harm's way.  Seriously, several times I hoped the professional and intelligent combo of Scooby and Shaggy would help these morons investigate the crime more effectively.  That's how silly it is!Through it all, Elwes overacts (a common trait)--but, at least, it can be amusing at times.  And I'll take my amusement where I can in this film.  Like I said, the film seems to aspire to comment on the hypocrisy and complicity of TV programs in creating fame-seeking murderers--but the link is not well established (even though it's an easy target).  So the film fails at satire, in addition to everything else.  A silly disappointment that had the potential to be clever, but was too lazy to follow through with anything original.

The entire premise is absurd and unconvincing, and the ending is so amateurish that you are left shaking your head in disbelief. You are occasionally startled by a loud noise, but not once will you be truly frightened or convinced that any of this nonsense is even remotely real or possible.I generally love Michael Keaton and am a great fan of supernatural thrillers, but I was totally let down on both fronts. M.K. exudes not a single trace of the edgy charisma, humor, and intellect that usually distinguishes his performances. He (and we) spend what seems like hours and days looking at snowy screens and listening to indistinct static, with an occasional groan or whimper. Just to be sure, however, that we ignoramuses in the audience fully comprehend the grand significance of what is transpiring, occasionally the fuzzy images become completely distinct, the voices become very clear, all spooky subtlety is lost and we are essentially told what to think. There is no respect for the audience...but then again, if there were any, this movie would never have been released.The childish manipulation is obvious and very tiresome, but the worst insult is reserved for the truly lousy ending....lots of swirly, silly ghosts and loud noises that grate on our nerves rather than fears. I swear that I have seen Halloween plays at my daughter's grade school that were more suspenseful and displayed better plot and direction. This is an absolute bomb, and I don't mean that in a good way.The Special Features on the DVD consist mainly of a sweet little old couple running around deserted buildings with a $5 Radio Shack tape recorder saying things like ""Speak to us""....and of course, after they are allowed to ""privately process"" their recordings there are a few unusual beeps and squawks that are interpreted as long-dead souls attempting to communicate. Why these voices are audible only to the sweet little old couple's tape recorder and not our ears is never explained, nor why any ""processing"" is necessary....although I think we all know why it is.Please heed my warnings and avoid this turkey at all costs. It truly is just as bad as the critics said it was.....maybe even worse.

I own the VHS of the original short film, as it had never been formatted to DVD, and I'll always keep the VHS if nothing more than just nostalgia.  It is unclear to me if the DVD/Blu-Ray release will contain the original short film, but I am hoping that it will so that I can watch it again.When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to do an animated reimagining of Frankenweenie, I was excited...I have been a long time Tim Burton fan and was very intrigued to see his reimagining of his original film. Sometimes other people will venture to try and remake classics, and a lot of times they'll wind up being mediocre or not even all that good, with some exceptions of course.  However, knowing that Tim Burton would be remaking it, it'd be good.The movie follows the same concept...a boy who loves his dog and loses him figures out how to bring him back and does so.  However, in this extended remake, other kids catch onto this and decide to try and bring back their own pets and things go horribly wrong.  I am not going to say anything further about it for anyone who has not seen it, but things get a bit out of control in the end to say the least.Much as the original Frankenweenie was a great homage to Frankenstein, this reimagining is a great homage to monster movies in general.  I'd say there are parts in this that maybe might be a tad scary for kids under 5 perhaps, but that's up to the discerning parent to decide.  Beyond that though, I'd say this movie would be enjoyable to pretty much anyone, especially to anyone who enjoys monster movies, especially the classics.  I'd definitely check it out!",0.5,1,16,2,47,0,1,1736,320,1,0.1618055555555556,0.625,66.78,35.61,0.19493138642385244,0.19081603201466912,0.03739010845451536,0.002381722524827807,0.5744807505821351,0.009216589861751152,0.0002878526194588371,3,5.0,0.0283392,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

Based on the classic book by A. A. Milne, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh delightfully brings to life Christopher Robin, The Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh, and all of his friends.  Included are the all the timeless favorites:  Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974).  Wow, was it really as late as 1974 that we met Tigger for the first time?  I feel like I have know him since I was born!This masterpiece contains some of the most incredible, memorable, and recognizable voice talent of all time, including Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet.  Sebastian Cabot narrates, speaking directly to the characters and to us, and tying all the stories together.  Pooh and his friends clearly loved Sebastian Cabot just as much as we did.The songs are most firmly fixed in my mind - ""Hefalumps and Woozles"", ""The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers"", ""I'm Just a Little Back Rain Cloud"", and of course ""Winnie the Pooh"" to name just a few.  We hum and sing and dance to each one.  The memories are strong here; all the words come pouring back.For the 25th anniversary addition, the animation has been lovingly and vividly restored to its original glory.  This DVD is as stunning as I remember the originals to be. As the pages of the book turn, Pooh seems to leap off the page, and into your heart.My young one loves this as much as I do.  She requests this DVD frequently, and I am more than thrilled to be able to share it with her.  Thank you, Walt, for giving me these beautiful memories to pass on to my daughter.",1.0,0,39,6,64,1,1,1770,314,1,0.3560714285714285,0.6000000000000001,79.19,48.47,0.369955218282129,0.2754681058031008,0.0398106277443726,0.3117980656325131,0.002967982537884387,0.022033898305084745,0.000564652738565782,1,,0.0,0.75,0.0,5.0,long,

A Preteen Version of 'The Breakfast Club',"This is my 8 year old daughters favourite film and I found it very reminiscent of the great John Hughes films of the 1980s. It is very good and really entertaining. It's good to see a childrens film that is more about the characters than special effects.The airport setting is well utilised - who wouldn't secretly like to rummage around the fabulous lost luggage mountains and who knew there were emergency equipment rooms like that? Shops, restaurants and cell blocks all play a part. The group of misfit to cool children are literally 'grounded' as their flights home at Christmas have been cancelled due to snow. As unaccompanied minors travelling home from boarding schools, divorced parents etc they create havoc and end up as grounded in the punishment sense but still manage to get the better of the adults.It is fast and funny with entertaining dialogue and a great set of actors. The children are the stars and literally run rings around the adults. There is an intelligent storyline behind all the mayhem too and it's a great Christmas feel good film.Highly recommended for children and for adults who now have pre teen children and liked 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Trains, Planes and Automobiles'. Luckily this film pays hommage to those films and builds on them in 21st century style.",0.0,0,52,8,25,1,0,1296,220,1,0.3670190476190476,1.0,69.82,63.36,0.0032080939435478314,0.543422495158551,0.0032073760502969177,0.44693628864835705,0.0032257461992472487,0.040123456790123455,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

It's good, I think, to strive for accuracy and truth to original intent.After reading many of the reviews on Amazon about the various versions of the original trilogy (on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray), I am just confused.  Still, fwiw, I do recall ""A New Hope"" not being on the crawl when I saw the original Star Wars in a theater in 1977.I just finished watching the Blu-ray version of Episode IV, and I thought it was fabulous, even if Greedo did shoot first this time around. That does bother me a little, but it happened so fast, I must say I wouldn't have noticed it had I not seen someone wearing a ""Han Shot First"" T-shirt the other day.Here's the catch, as far as I'm concerned. Han Solo commented that the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in less that 12 parsecs. Hello! A parsec, as many of us space geeks and also even regular people know, is a unit of distance and not of time. Can't believe I didn't notice that in the 70s, when I was even geekier, and certainly more observant (I would think), than the current middle-aged version of me. Wonder if this blunder was added as an ""enhancement""?Just had to go on record about that parsec thing. Still, I thought the Blu-Ray version was great, and I'm going to just stop trying to figure out what's original and what was changed along the way.

I watched the Day After Tomorrow yesterday and watched Van Helising today. I must say that Van Helsing is much funner movie and the one I'd want to watch more than once. People knock it for having so much action, well isn't that good ? I mean to me that made it entertaining through-out and it was never dull. I actually saw a 1 out of 10 review for this at igndvd.com and no way is this movie that bad. Maybe I liked it because I always wanted a movie with all the classic monsters together. I think Stephen Sommers does a pretty damn good job making adventures though. I actually liked the Mummy movies and if you liked those then you should be blown away by Van Helsing. I also really liked the look of the film, it a has a really nice classic monster movie look to it. Plus Hugh Jackman does a fine job in the title role, but when isn't he good ?

Side-note: BBC TV seems to have many shows of much higher quality than American TV; perhaps because they have less competition and better funding?  On the other hand, often a &#34;season&#34; has much fewer shows than the American audience is used to.  Back to this series: I wasn't able to suspend disbelief.  Even for fiction, there has to be some credibility.  Here, from the outset the young doctor fresh from graduation beginning actual practice, is constantly confronted by an older, much more jaded version of himself.  How is that supposed to be happening?  The show makes no effort at explanation.  By the end of season one there's even a suggestion he's no longer quite the green doctor and may be also confronting an even greener version of himself already...Yes there is some dark and understated humor, primarily through the expressions, the dialog and the actions of the staff surrounding this doctor in a very small and remote hospital/clinic setting.

Sometimes It's An Escape...,"That Jane Austen is one of the penultimate authors of the 19th century is undeniable. Without exception, all of her films have been turned into films. From her lesser knownNorthanger AbbeyandPersuasionto her more popularSense & Sensibilityand, the crown jewel,Pride and Prejudice. Her characters' romances have inspired writers and made women swoon. But where did Jane get her inspiration?BECOMING JANE tells us--in no uncertain terms--that life frequently imitates art. We're shown, however, that Jane's choices were often in direct opposition to her writings. Jane never married, had only one true love, and was shunned by the literary community of the times because of her sex (women who wrote fiction were often considered scandalous).Connections between her stories and her real life are shoved down the viewers' throats, making true discovery by the movie-watcher impossible (""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea for Mr. Darcy."" And, ""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea forEmma."") The list is long and exceptionally easy. The complexity of her stories didn't match the simplicity of Becoming Jane's screenplay is what I'm saying.The relationship between Jane (Anne Hathaway,The Devil Wears Prada) and her one true love Tom (James McAvoy,Atonement) is well played but leaves little doubt about where Ms. Austen came up with her Darcy personae. The ending made this an easier pill to swallow, which also raised my rating of the film (it is in keeping with the times that Ms. Austen grew up and the restrictions placed on those people of money and property, and those without).This film also points to a sad end for Ian Richardson, who died soon after the film's completion. Richardson plays Judge Langlois who lords over Tom as his uncle (Richardson is known for his amazing TV repertoire ...fromBleak HousetoSherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles) Tom (McAvoy) is Judge Langlois' heir apparent, and is forced to do the unthinkable when given the choice between love or money (or family abroad). In true sacrificial fashion, Jane refuses him his sacrifice and, in the end, chooses the life of an unwedded old maid. But she has her writings, and uses them to insert herself into a life she should have lived (living vicariously through her characters).No doubt Becoming Jane was also Hollywoodized, making Jane's life seem more interesting than it was. Liberties with film will always be taken, though. It just depends on how much that irks you as the viewer. For someone as important to literature as Ms. Austen, it might be more irksome than entertaining.",0.5,1,60,9,92,1,0,2588,422,1,0.19260620915032683,0.0,64.71,58.45,0.02520303003666195,0.08444414513098288,0.0018594509435253491,0.8389436647628694,0.04954970912596039,0.023183925811437404,0.00019312475859405175,4,3.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,1.0,long,

Mottola proved his comedic talent in that flick, but here in Adventureland pulls back and gives us more of a bittersweet love story with a comedic shell.For those of you who saw (and loved)Zombieland, you'll definitely want to see Jesse Eisenberg in this film. Although he's not running for his life from brain-starved zombies, he is running toward a life as a man, trying to figure out where he's going and how he wants his life to pan out.Kristen Stewart (Into the Wild) plays the love interest. She's the perfect confused and embittered daughter of a recently remarried father and ""evil"" stepmother. Finding solace in the sexual declivities of a married maintenance man, Arlene (Stewart) sees a kind spirit in James (Eisenberg), and the two form a budding romance that rocks, shatters, and builds as they discover what each has to offer the other.The entire film circles around James' need to earn some cash for college after his parents' finances fall apart. He finds the only job offered to him at an amusement park named, yep, Adventureland. It is run by Bobby (comedic superstar Bill Hader,Tropic Thunder) and his wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig,Knocked Up). This park and it's workers are what makes for an interesting and occasionally funny mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand. The crew that helps run the park are as diverse as America itself, and often just as screwed up. One of them has been a long-time friend of James' and loves punching him in the groin. Another (known only as Lisa P) is the sexually desirable yet unknown virginal girl that all the guys lust after. And still another is an obviously mentally challenged security guard who is the knowledge-base about everyone and everything that goes on within (and around) the park.As you can see, there's a lot going on, and not all of it is funny. In fact, if you go into the film thinking it's going to be SUPERBAD 2, prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the previews gave that impression. Although there's comedy lightly (very lightly) sprinkled throughout, it's not what makes this movie go. It is post-teen angst and a surprisingly great love story that allows many of us a walk down memory lane.",0.75,1,43,9,88,0,0,2833,487,1,0.1998024691358025,0.35,66.98,100.75,0.0017820907224803284,0.22659117916109509,0.001782139120891841,0.6934317022791421,0.07641288871639065,0.015178256265442993,0.0002646436132674665,4,3.0,0.03672,0.6,0.75,5.0,long,

Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here.  First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film.  He could have contented himself making ""Lethal Weapon"" sequels and ""What Women Want"", films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance.  To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage.  As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres.  The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity.  There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity.  This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before.  As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus.  He does not so much capture Christ's divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson's than the actor's.  Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother.  Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son.  Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate.  I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here.  There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative.  On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson.  Gibson included a commentary on the ""Braveheart"" DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it's kind.  My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money.",0.8461538461538461,2,45,8,44,0,0,2265,403,1,0.08625000000000001,0.0,66.88,88.74,0.36184389595687205,0.0022795141304169644,0.002270528744327608,0.6078381190082011,0.025767942160182307,0.019867549668874173,0.00037341299477221804,13,4.7272727272727275,0.0,0.7857142857142857,1.6923076923076923,4.2,long,

Filmed in black-and-white in a cinema verite style this film lays out the methodically brutal methods of the consortium that spread fear to the lawless and law abiding alike.  The film focuses on the crime empire of Lepke (David J. Stewart) and how he held his grip on power through his vicious subordinates.  None of his cronies was more brutal than Abe Reles, portayed here by Peter Falk in a volcanic film debut.  Falk is listed in a supporting role here but his aura elevates an already fine film to another level.  If you want to contrast Falk's work here I found it akin to that of Joe Pesci's portrayal of Tommy DeVito in ""Goodfellas"".  Stuart Whitman and May Britt play a young couple ensnared by circumstance as accomplices to Lepke.

The storied history of the attack on Pearl Harbor has become a $100+ million dollar effects spectacular (...) and it's quite sad.The script is just absolutely hideous. There is no emotional pull to draw you in and although the movie tries it ends up with only cheap melodrama in its place. The love story/best friends plotline is just a two bit way of trying to make you care what happens to the characters, but just comes off as laughable. You couldn't care a lick for anybody, and it's only made worse that the actors, particularly Baldwin and Affleck, deliver utterly inane dialogue with the most serious conviction that you end up smirking at it. Cuba Gooding had the most minor of roles in the movie so I'm not even sure why his character was even included. It added nothing whatsoever to the already weak plot. And there are plenty of other minor characters that leave you with just as much a sense of unfeeling. Affleck is also a weak, weak lead. This movie may try to mimic the feel of 1940s cinema, but Affleck is no Cary Grant, that's for sure. You end up hating him rather than identifying with him because he's so annoying.There are many problems here to be sure, but the one thing I did like was Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR. Sure, his dialogue was just as weak as all the rest, but at least he was kind of convincing as a president desperate not to be seen as a physically uncapable leader.You can see this movie, just don't expect much out of it. It's an embarrassment to the memory of those who lived through this horrific event.

The real show's host Garrison Keillor, wrote the screenplay and played GK, the host in the movie. The movie depicts the final broadcast of the show. It will be canceled by a mega corporation that bought the radio station and the building will be torn down to give the space for the new parking lot. As always in Altman movie, a cast is terrific and includes Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lindsay Lohan, John C. Reilly, Tommy Lee Jones, Virginia Madsen and Kevin Kline. There are many songs performed by the show regulars and I truly enjoyed singing by Streep and Tomlin as the sisters Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson. Their on-screen timing and delivery of the famous Altman's overlapping dialogs are one of the movie's greatest pleasures. Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly), two cowboy singers making fun of each other with the deadly serious faces were hilarious and their never ending song ""Bad Jokes"" was a scream. I wanted them to be on the screen longer. I would not call ""A Prairie Home Companion"" one of the best Altman's movies - it is not. There were some characters and elements of plot that seemed either under-developed or not necessary. As much as I like Kevin Klein, his Private Eye working for the show, Guy Noir seemed out of place. Beautiful and mysterious woman in white (Virginia Madsen) brings to mind not just one but two movies, ""Wings of Desire"" and ""City of Angels"". Well, the appearance of an Angel during the last ever broadcast seems to be justified. Shows like people go through the circle of life from birth to death but sadly, Madsen has not much to play. Not as great as ""Nashville"", the last (and sadly it IS his last) Altman's movie dedicated to Country music is still charming and quirky and I am glad that I saw it.3.5/5",1.0,0,22,5,68,0,0,1925,340,1,0.15977196204468935,0.0,70.43,100.24,0.05707185852098427,0.32930062615185346,0.0025382006780789823,0.6085429381786153,0.0025463764704679714,0.011428571428571429,0.0005192107995846313,4,4.666666666666667,0.0,0.5,0.0,4.0,long,

The plot is captivating with Bullock playing the &quot;sensible sister&quot; and Kidman as the &quot;free spirited sister&quot;, yet each have their own sadness and burden to carry.  The story slowly unfolds and it also captures the viewers interest as well. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest portray the sisters Aunts, and they are charming and fun to watch. Goran Visnjic is scary as the evil guy that Kidman is involved with and Adian Quinn, is the innocent bystander who quickly becomes involved in the plot (which I wont tell, but believe me its great!).This is a movie that both men and women can watch and maybe learn a little more about each other and how the opposite sex thinks.

This guy is gorgeous. It wasn't until the movie started playing that I realized there was a popular cast in this film (Susan Sarandon, Penelope Cruz, Robin Williams). Daniel Sunjata looks familiar to me although I don't know him from any of his IMDB credits, but he was another guy who was nice to look at. The movie circles around three topics--one woman who lost her child on Christmas; a couple who may not be getting married because of the guy's jealous attitude; and a man who has a secret. Two of the stories connect to Paul Walker's character Mike Riley. Rose Collins' (played by Sarandon) was depressing to me, and I started fast-forwarding through her scenes, minus the back-to-your-place scene with Daniel Sunjata and all of the scenes with Robin Williams. The movie was cool, but I don't think Rose Collins was necessary. The movie was busy enough with the triangle between Mike, the weird older guy who keeps following him (I thought it was for a completely different reason so his scenes were not at all predictable) and Nina Vasquez (played by Penelope Cruz). Only thing is I never really got the chemistry between Penelope and Paul. Paul Walker with Eva Mendes? Totally loved it and was convinced it could work. Him and Penelope? They never seemed like they were on the same page of passion but always neck and neck when it came to anger.Anyway, the film was OK.

Jordan definitely had more face time on the film and I enjoyed the parts with him. Without spoiling the movie, the movie was better in scenes that he was in than it was in scenes that he was not. After a particular lightning scene, then the movie went downhill and became one long scene of ""Look, let me show you this trick. Let me show you how strong I am.""

It's not as well known as it's peers, but it should be.It's about a model, Alison, who rents an apartment and finds she has a bunch of oddball eccentrics as neighbors(including a masturbating Beverly D'Angelo, who'd be welcome at my apartment anytime).  Turns out that these neighbors aren't really neighbors, but specters.  Looks like Alison's sharing the building with only one other tenant-a locked in reclusive priest(John Carradine) on the top floor.  Spooky and ghastly goings on start in Alison's apartment, and it's starting to look like she's out of her tree, but her lawyer boyfriend, Michael(Jerry Dandridge....I mean, Chris Sarandon) doesn't think she's so crazy and starts to dig.  What he finds is a rather interesting plot involving the catholic church.  The final act unleashes some neat looking demons that look like they walked off the set of one of Frank Henenlotter's Basket Case films!  I'm not gonna spill the beans on the whole thing, but it's a neat spin on the many satanic 70s film plots.This film has familiar faces up the wazoo!  Blink your eyes and you may miss one or two.

But still, you have to ask yourself: how memorable was Hannibal Rising if I forgot about it while listing out the movies I'd seen this weekend to review, and not remembered to add it to that list for over an hour?Now, I'll admit that I'm judging this movie more harshly than I otherwise would because it's from the long-bleeding and damned-close-to-dead Hannibal franchise, but screenwriter Harris (adapting from his own novel) and director Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) really invite that sort of thing; there are little visual clues to the other movies littered throughout, including the infamous scene of a young Lecter (A Very Long Engagement's Gaspard Ulliel) trying on the bottom half of the samurai mask, which directly resembles the masked forced upon Anthony Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs. Even that would be forgivable if the armor ever ended up being more than set decoration in this movie. But no-- it's there for the sole purpose of throwing the audience a biscuit. Really, what can you say to that?Divorced from the mythology, it would probably be a serviceable little thriller, a kind of I Spit on Your Grave-lite. Lecter and his family are living in Lithuania in 1944-- not a very nice place to be, as the Germans and the Russians are about to collide on their doorstep. Eight-year-old Hannibal, his younger sister Mischa, and his mother and father, along with some servants, retreat to the country house just before the Germans, with some SS-wannabe tagalongs headed by Grutas (Danny Deckchair's Rhys Ifans), get to Lecter Castle and start murdering the help. Through various chains of coincidence, the surviving Lecters and Grutas' band both end up barricaded in the country house, where bad things happen, and Hannibal vows revenge. Yeah, you've heard it all a million times before. And it works, kind of, in the sense that you know what's coming within a few minutes of the opening (really, if you've seen the rest of the movies in the canon, you knew what was coming from the moment you first heard this movie was in production). In that respect, it's analogous to any of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels; you're looking forward to the next inventive death, rather than worrying about such details as plot, characterization, etc. All of which do exist here as a kind of thin veneer, so at least it ranks above any Friday the 13th after the second one.One high point n the movie bears mentioning, though. I've been seeing more and more of Richard Brake (who here plays one of Grutas' underlings) recently, usually in really, really bad movies. But the more I see of the guy, the more I like him. He's wonderful at playing slime. One of these days, he's going to break out and become ""that guy you know, but can never remember his name,"" like William Fichtner. Be ready, you can say you knew him when.Other than that, really, as long as you can turn your brain off for two hours and aren't terribly insulted by Harris' pandering, you'll have some fun with this. **",0.3333333333333333,2,7,1,117,2,0,3104,539,1,0.0815829408686552,-1.0,62.41,36.62,0.0015872566022839241,0.0015597780900861284,0.00154469889495421,0.28410141933904304,0.7112068470736326,0.0022551546391752575,0.00010735373054213633,12,2.9,0.04104,0.25,0.6666666666666666,1.0,long,

I have lost count of the number of times I've seen the Missing in Action flicks over the years; I had both on a scratchy VHS I taped from HBO back in my high school days along with The Octagon, and I watched that tape incessantly. But somehow I'd never got round to seeing Good Guys Wear Black until now. I wish I hadn't.I'd like to give you a plot synopsis. I really would. It has something to do with an elite squad of assassins during the Vietnam War who, years later, are being bumped off one by one thanks to some guy's political aspirations. (This is not a spoiler; the opening scene sets it up in such a way that there's only one real explanation.) But the plot gets bogged down a number of times and disappears entirely in others thanks to a script (by one guy who never worked in Hollywood again, as far as I can tell, and one who was working on his first screenplay; this was Mark Medoff, who obviously went to screenwriting school after this, since he was justly nominated for an Oscar less than a decade later for Children of a Lesser God) that makes as little sense as it possibly can and still remain marginally coherent. It's like a falling-down drunk quantum physicist trying to explain quarks to you when you never got beyond third-grade math, except in this scenario you're the genius. It's entirely the movie's fault that it makes no sense.Still, the movie's worth watching entirely for one cameo. Jim Backus (yes, Thurston Howell III!) plays a doorman towards the end of the movie, and he's by far the best actor to be found here. Anne Archer pops up as Chuck Norris' love interest. Dana Andrews, at the twilight of his career (he would make just three more feature films) shows up as an old, nasty drunk politician; think of him as Charles Laughton in Advise and Consent, except that Laughton brought his A game to that film, while Andrews brings his D game here (though his final soliloquy is one of the movie's few high points). If you're not a big Chuck Norris fan, though, you can probably skip it and not be missing much. Actually, you can also do so if you are a big Chuck Norris fan. **",0.5,1,43,6,73,0,1,2244,415,1,0.022096949891067547,0.7,73.51,48.47,0.027639621317069037,0.11207722852961298,0.0017979540340608419,0.35435090840666167,0.5041342877125954,0.019162210338680926,0.00022271714922048998,12,2.9,0.0120096,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

The others follow a sequential pattern, more or less (ok less!) that this one doesn't fit. THe basic story revolves around the eternal love triangle and throw in Dracula. An older brother loves a girl who loves the younger, ne'er-do-well brother. The younger brother leaves town, after being too friendly with the Burgermeister's daughter and ends up at dracula's castle.The older brother and the girl travel to find him and end up in Dracula's castle. The younger brother is found dead, gruesomely killed, and in a fiery ending, Dracula is immolated and the castle collapses.Dracula has more lines in this one and it does show that vampires aren't the suave, debonair misunderstood victims of a blood disease. Dracula is cruel, sadistic, maniacal and Lee does a good job portraying him so. The dismemberment scene is done with excruciating detail, unlike a similiar one in Taste the blood of Dracula. The blood splatters, used to show that Dracula drank blood and it got all over the place, are fake looking and unimpressive. I think the original intent was to show the dark side of vampires, not the sanitized portrayal of the other films but it failed in presenting a coherent whole. Rather it was a disjointed production that looked slapped together for a drive-in double feature. Lots of potential that went unrealized.The scenery is scant and cardboard-like, with very little attempt at realism. The actors are wooden, except for Lee, and you end up not caring whether they live or die.

This biopic of Alexander the Great flounders on almost every level and is probably most notable for making the overblown Troy seem good in comparison.Any scrutiny as to why this movie fails must begin with Colin Farrell who plays the title character.  Farrell, in the right context, is a decent enough actor, but he's out of his element here.  He is supposed to play a great leader, but is not believable in his role.  When Russell Crowe inspires his troops in Gladiator, we believe he's a good general; when Farrell does it in this movie, the only thing I'm inspired to do is eject the DVD (but somehow I resisted and stuck with the film to the end).  It is impossible to accept that this is a man who could command any real loyalty.Stone's direction is mediocre.  The battle sequences are not all that entertaining and his attempts to be ""artistic"" come off as merely pretentious.  With the sole exception of Val Kilmer, all the actors are either chewing the scenery (such as Angelina Jolie) or underdeveloped.  Unfortunately, Kilmer's decent performance is far from enough to carry this movie.At least a film like XXX - State of the Union doesn't pretend to be great, so when it fails, we're not all that disappointed.  Not so, here.  There is undoubtedly a good movie that could be made out of the life of Alexander the Great.  It hasn't arrived yet.  If it were a film of normal length, it might be worth viewing just to see how bad it is, but at three hours, it's probably better to skip it and watch another, shorter bad movie instead.

After all of the hype, and all of the box office success, I know what the big deal was all about.  Simply put: Pixar makes great movies.  Finding Nemo is a lot of fun to watch, and has some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen.The story is rather simple.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a Clown Fish.  Marlin is the single parent of a little clown fish, Nemo (Alexander Gould).  Marlin is a very over-protective parent and while Nemo is away at school (clever, no?) he is taken by a scuba-diver.  This is the branching point of the story.  The movie switches back between Marlin and Nemo.  We see Nemo taken away and what his life is like in a fish tank.  We also see Marlin's quest to find Nemo and bring him back home.  Marlin has a huge adventure as he tries to rescue Nemo.  He meets up with another fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), and together they track down Nemo.  Dory is an interesting fish, as she has a limited short term memory and keeps forgetting things.  Together they deal with sharks, jelly fish, pelicans, and sea turtles and everything feels extraordinary and fun.Fun is the bottom line with this movie.  It is simply a lot of fun to watch (for children of all ages) and the animation is simply stunning.  Finding Nemo also features the voice talent of Willem Dafoe, Alison Janney, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Geoffrey Rush.  I would like to highlight the work of Ellen DeGeneres.  Her voice work was part of what made the character of Dory for me.  It was a funny character, a sweet character, and perhaps the most sympathetic character.  Dory was a lot of fun (like so much in this movie) and is probably my favorite character.  I would recommend Finding Nemo to anyone (and everyone).",1.0,0,28,5,60,1,0,1801,324,1,0.22387772817460316,1.0,75.2,66.4,0.0025094167261230887,0.39206986832240515,0.07642220607760629,0.5264870061698486,0.002511502704016976,0.015546918378678512,0.0005549389567147614,3,5.0,0.0221184,0.6666666666666666,0.0,4.571428571428571,long,

While I realize that she is an actor (and a fine one) who is only playing a seriously unhinged character in P.J. Hogan's ""Mental"", it's just that she's played these seriously unhinged characters so frequently, and with such unflagging gusto, I am starting to wonder if this woman really is off her rocker. And if she is, know that I'm not judging.In this outing, Collette (who made her bones as Hogan's leading lady in his 1994 hit ""Muriel's Wedding"") plays a Nanny from Hell named Shaz (think Mary Poppins meets Courtney Love). She hitchhikes into a New South Wales burg, accompanied by her trusty dog, Ripper. She's picked up by Barry Moochmore (Anthony LaPaglia), an exasperated father of five daughters. He is at wit's end, because his wife Shirley (Rebecca Gibney) who has a history of mental issues, believes that she is Maria von Trapp. Consequently, Barry, an ambitious politician, has sent his wife ""on holiday"" (the laughing house) on the eve of a campaign. What to do about his daughters?For unfathomable reasons beyond the ken of any halfway responsible parent, Barry offers the off-the-wall Shaz a gig as the family nanny. With his wife tucked away under psychiatric observation and his children under possibly psychotic supervision by a total stranger, Barry can now get back on track with his true passions: philandering and politicking. Needless to say, this highly dysfunctional home environment has imbued the Moochmore sisters with assorted neuroses of their own; but as we've learned from similar (and superior) films like Bill Forsyth's ""Housekeeping"" and Eugene Corr's ""Desert Bloom"", it's nothing that the Kooky Free Spirited Auntie can't cure with a few wacky bonding escapades and ""just between us girls"" heart-to-heart sessions.A wild pastiche of general hysteria, screeching actors, busy sets and loud colors, ""Mental"" is a cacophonous, anxiety-inducing assault on the senses. Hogan told an interviewer that the story is loosely autobiographical, that there really was a ""Shaz"" who played a similar role in his childhood. That's nice to know, but why turn such a potentially interesting personal memoir into what amounts to a live action Saturday morning cartoon?  Now that I think about it, it is not unlike a Pedro Almodovar film; except Almodovar seems to know when to put a sock in it and allow his narrative to breathe a bit. While there's something to be said for quirk, ebullience and verve (of which this film certainly has no shortage), Hogan refuses to let viewers up for air, leaving us to drown in his enthusiasm.",0.5,1,18,3,102,2,0,2596,428,1,0.10561393152302245,-0.1,55.78,59.97,0.002405443112779475,0.00240528434283684,0.0023964510495586037,0.7934373682254543,0.19935545326937085,0.006933744221879815,0.00019252984212552945,3,2.0,0.108864,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

To the east lies an ocean.  On the landward side, it is surrounded by an endless wasteland known as the Forbidden Zone.Living in this paradise are apes and humans.  The apes are the dominant life form; the humans are second bananas.  These humans have lost the capacity of speech.  They are uncivilized.  There lives are short, not because of disease, but because the apes are hunting them to extinction.The burgeoning simian society is made up of three classes.  There are the gorillas; their main activity is to hunt humans.  Those not killed are used for research and target practice.  Their General sent scouts into the Forbidden Zone; only one came back.Then there are the chimpanzees; they are the intellectuals, scientists, and veterinarians.  Although the gorilla's believe there is nothing to be learned by studying humans, they do allow the chimpanzees to examine and experiment on them.And lastly, there are the baboons; they are the administrators.  Most prominent, Doctor Zaius is the Minister of Science and The Chief Defender of the Faith.  He is privy to secret scrolls that, if revealed, would expose the truth about man and destroy the apes age of innocence.In the first movie, Taylor's starship crashes; he is captured, but then escapes with Nova into the Forbidden Zone.  In this sequel, Brent is sent to rescue Taylor, but his starship also crashes.  He meets Nova; she has Taylor's dog tags dangling around her neck.  Where's Taylor?

That describes &quot;Murder by Death.&quot;  Spoofing everyone from Miss Marple to Sam Spade, Charlie Chan to The Thin Man, and everyone in between, Neil Simon's script (outdoing such Simon  classics as &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;) is so far out there that one can  only fall in love with this movie.Being a big fan of mysteries,  parodies, and all-star casts, this was the movie for me.  The whole cast  has a ball and hams it up to High Heaven.  I love David Niven and Maggie  Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston.  Smith especially soars, giving an  offhanded, almost nonchalant performance that leaves you rolling in the  aisles.  Elsa Lanchester is great as Jessica Marbles, and Estelle Winwood,  in a very small role, gets a few good lines as her senile nurse.  (Watch  for their entrance!)  James Coco is a comic riot as the always-hungry  Monsieur Perrier.  Peter Sellers is classic again as Inspector Wang (with  every line funnier than the last).  He has more proverbs than all the  fortune cookies in Chinatown: &quot;Treacherous road like-a fresh  mushroom...&quot;  Peter Falk is insane as really-not-quite-there Sam  Diamond, and Truman Capote gets in a fun cameo appearance as their puckish  host, Lionel Twain.  Smith, Coco, Sellers, and Falk shine.  But two of the  best performances are in rather small roles played by a pre-&quot;Star  Wars&quot; Sir Alec Guiness (so don't expect to hear the Force theme on his  entrance) showing his comedic talent as the blind butler, Bensonmum, and  &quot;Rhoda&quot; alum, the great Nancy Walker, as the deaf-and-dumb cook,  Yetta.  These two have some of the funniest scenes in film history, each  playing marvelously off the other's shortcomings.  (Watch for when  Bensonmun &quot;fires&quot; her--even holding the door open and pointing  out--while she looks on, bewildered!)The classic lines are everywhere.  Falk: &quot;I gotta go to da can.  Sometimes I talk so much, I forget ta  go.&quot;  Lanchester: &quot;Pardon my language, but it scared the ca-ca  out of me!&quot; Smith: (in response) &quot;You know, Dicky, I like her.  I  really like her.&quot;  Capote: (chastising Sellers' broken English)  &quot;IT!  IT!  Use your damn pronouns!&quot;  Perrier's driver: (About a  chocolate bar with almonds instead of nuts) &quot;The man at the store had  no nuts.&quot; Coco: (responding) &quot;He was short?&quot;  Sellers:  &quot;Look! Voice come from cow on wall!&quot;  But the best line in the  whole movie is when the butler has been gone for quite some time and not  returned with their meal, and starving Coco, in detective mode, says,  &quot;The most important question is: Where is the butler?  And why has he  not returned...(Screaming dramatically)...WITH OUR DINNER! &quot;I was  in a murder-mystery play last year in which one character was a sendup of  Truman Capote; I loaned this video to the actor who had that part.  And  this week, I'm playing a role in Agatha Christie's &quot;Ten Little  Indians,&quot; in which Estelle Winwood (Ms. Marbles' nurse in this film)  originated the stage role of Emily Brent in 1944.This is a really fun  movie to watch on a Friday night with lots of friends--for even more fun,  watch it back-to-back with &quot;Clue!&quot;",0.9423076923076923,3,25,5,201,2,10,3259,515,1,0.10386666666666666,1.0,73.88,100.24,0.0013388100258123663,0.12975314725342232,0.5074437529669948,0.3601258561851419,0.0013384335686285156,0.007671064743786438,0.0002890514393581878,1,,0.0,0.9245283018867925,2.8269230769230766,4.0,long,

The African children did a great job in their roles and I give credit to the ""24 staff for bringing in actor John Voight to play the role as the corrupted person in the government.As mentioned, the cinematography capturing the scenery was just great.  The staff managed to capture the beauty and danger of Africa despite the many challenges faced during the shooting schedule.  I was truly impressed.The storyline was just engaging, action-packed and thrilling from start to finish.  Needless to say, I can't wait for Season 7.As for the DVD, the DVD features two versions of ""Redemption"".  The broadcast version and the extended version which has over 10 minutes of extra footage).  The extra footage are mainly dialogue between the incoming President and outgoing President and scenes that primary taking place in Washington.  You can learn more about the additional scenes from the actual commentary.VIDEO & AUDIO:""24: Redemption"" is featured in widescreen 1:78:1.  The picture quality is vibrant..  Especially when you see the differences of the Africa and the US scenes.  Africa is featured in amber/Earthy hues and looks beautiful.  While the US has a colorful but a different sense color which leans more towards dark bluish hues.  Video quality looked vibrant and colorful.As for audio, the show is featured in Digital 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Really good audio quality during the fighting sequences in Africa.  Otherwise, the special features mostly dialogue and the dialogue can be heard quite clearly.SPECIAL FEATURES:I admit that I was happy to see quite a few specials included on the DVD.  Special features are:* The Making of 24: Redemption Featurette - This featurette is about 20 minutes long and is actually very good.  Especially if you are a filmmaker.  Director Jon Cassar, writer Howard Gordon and staff are interviewed on how it was to film in Africa but the challenges that they faced.  I was surprised to see how the weather would change in an hour-time. They could be filming and then all of a sudden, they get high winds (up to 60mph), then rain and hail and then sunlight.  So, it was definitely a challenge for them to film but they managed to do it.  But also, an advantage to work with people in South Africa in developing certain mechanical systems for the terrain and also interviews with the African talent.* ""Blood Never Dry"": Child Soldiers in Africa Featurette - In this featurette, cast from the upcoming Season 7 would read a letter from a child soldier and also a featurette that tries to explain why children are being kidnapped and becoming soldiers.  And the trauma they go through and not wanting to go home because they have committed atrocity to so many innocent people that they are deeply burdened by it.  Also, how the militias get these children so addicted to drugs.  This was a very good featurette and truly an eye opener of what is currently going on in Africa.* Commentary by Executive Producer/Director Jon Cassar and Executive Producers Howard Gordon and Kiefer Sutherland - The commentary was also enjoyable to listen to.  From filming of the scenes to the three talking about various actors and actresses and their experience filming the special.  Also, this is probably how one would learn about scenes that are in the expanded version and are not shown on the broadcast.* 24 Season 6 in Four Minutes Featurette - For those who missed or forgot what Season 6 is about.  This featurette features what happened during that season in four minutes.* An Exclusive First Look at 24 Season 7 - I was very impressed by the first 15 minutes of the upcoming ""Day 7' episode of ""Season 7' which will start the ""24' series in Jan. 2009.  A lot of action and what I can I say... Tony Almeida.  It's starts off awesome and I craved for more!I have been watching the ""24' series since the first episode and have always been hooked on the series. But this special was one of the finest ""24' storylines and I'm glad to see that the staff went all out in filming this special.  Especially bringing the staff and filming it in Africa was just impressive. ""24' has always been a drama series that has long been admired because it has set the marker so high for a television drama series.As for this DVD, not only was it fun to watch but if you are a film student or a person that enjoys watching ""24: Redemption"", you'll have a blast on watching how the special was created but most of all certain elements of nature that the staff had to contend with.  Especially during the rain and making it look like sunlight and also the high winds that the staff had to block out during the recording.Also, a thumbs up for the staff including the featurette on child soldiers. This featurette was definitely an eye-opener and I was really surprised to hear the chilling words from those who soldiers who are in agony of the deaths they have caused and the permanent guilt they have to live with.And of course, that sneak peak to excite the ""24' fan for a month until the Season 7 begins.Overall, if you are a ""24' fan, this DVD has so much to offer.

It seemed to me to be an adolescent's idea of sophistication. The direction was frenetic and I assume Luhrmann was aiming for an eccentric, romantic, funny style. For me, he didn't come close. The use of more-or-less contemporary popular songs just seemed to be ""nudge, nudge"" and unfunny. The dancing as well as the setups for the singing seemed clunky. The can-can sequence was all over the place; check out Renoir's French Cancan to see how a bawdy, rowdy can-can should be staged. Kidman has always seemed to me to be a somewhat cold, self-possessed actress. I was surprised at how loosened up she was here. Luhrmann was so good with Strictly Ballroom, where he used the same elements of exaggeration, talking directly to the camera, lush photography and a distinct style to great effect.

We'll miss them,"Song of the Thin Man is a sad-sweet experience, something like meeting a good friend you haven't seen in years and realizing how much affection you still have for him... but also how much you both have aged. It's been 13 years since The Thin Man appeared in 1934. We have to stop and remember that Nick Charles wasn't the thin man back then; that particular thin man was just one of the many murder victims Nick and Nora came across in their six movies. We remember the sophistication and insouciance of this affectionate and clever couple. They were never at a loss for a quick come-back or to shake a cold, gin martini. Even Nick's modus operandi to bring all the suspects together at the conclusion and pick apart the case until he has the murderer squirming never quite got stale. Alas, with Song of the Thin Man we have the MGM factory squeezing out one more film to try to wring a profit from it, this time attempting to make it ""contemporary"" by setting the story in the post-WWII social world of after-hours jazz clubs, bebop musicians and hep cat dialogue. Nick and Nora never looked uncomfortable anywhere their adventures took them in the past. They look at times now as out of place as salesmen from Peru, Indiana, at a Linda and Cole Porter party.Gone is the sophisticated world of white sofas and polished black floors, of naughty Porter lyrics and earnestly sophisticated Gershwin tunes. Martinis seem oddly old fashioned now (and so do Old Fashioneds) as Nick drinks high balls and Nora sips sherry. And instead of clever repartee, Song of the Thin Man gives us the kind of dialogue only studio journeymen can write. Says one character, ""I must have blown my top, kicking Buddy over for a road company Casanova like you!"" The solution depends on the kind of half-baked, melodramatic psychology popular at the time. To make it even more tedious, there are no characters except Nick and Nora to care about. The movie is peopled with crooks, opportunists, gold-diggers, scat-talking musicians and the unattractive rich. The acting is so variable that it doesn't take long to realize we're watching the kind of movie that MGM did not waste much effort on.Why spend time on it? Two names: William Powell and Myrna Loy. Even though 13 years have elapsed, even though, at 55, Powell is a little fuller around the face (Loy at 42 doesn't seem to have changed a bit) and even though WWII altered decisively the world of films, they remain one of the most refreshing, attractive and delightful movie pairs in screen history. They raise the movie, if at least not to their level, to a level of enduring affection for their style, their warmth, their intelligence and, that word again, their insouciance. So three stars is too much for the movie but five stars is too little for them.The DVD transfer looks just fine. There are a couple of extras, a cartoon and a short feature.",0.5,1,78,13,79,1,1,2882,507,1,0.1057878787878788,0.0,67.79,81.8,0.21995038720283047,0.001628225251488803,0.0016160913583612936,0.359987654345433,0.41681764184188647,0.027064538514920196,0.0001734304543877905,7,4.2,0.0139104,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

How to prove his innocence?Alfred Hitchcock's next-to-last film has a very English feel to it with an all-British cast and gritty London locations.  Void of scares but with grotesque and disturbing moments, the plot never arouses real 'frenzy' (especially among the audience); still, it is an entertaining, if low-budget, film.Scenes of cruelty are balanced with light-hearted marital humor, courtesy of Alec McCowan who plays the inspector on the case.  Jon Finch is good as the innocent man, although he lacks a certain charisma as does Barry Foster as a fruit seller.  Anna Massey gives a good performance as Richard's girlfriend, but, like the others, she seemed rather ordinary.The soundtrack is unremarkable and the most dramatic scenes lack music entirely.

I am sure glad to have found this four disc version and appreciate the movie better this time round.First of all, I thought the casting was excellent:Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is a little awkward and lacking in confidence, the kind that gets his hand caught in revolving doors. And Reeve did look like Superman physically and he was confident and cool. Very natural in both roles.Margot Kidder is perfect as the sharp tongued reporter Lois Lane. (Recall Gale Weathers in Scream?) Lois frequently makes spelling mistakes and gets told by her editor there's ""only one p in rapist"". Thank whoever invented spell check. One of Lois' interview questions for Superman was ""How big are you?"" She then changes the question quickly to ""How tall are you?"" What a size queen. LOL.Gene Hackman turns Lex Luthor into a very funny and likable ""criminal mind of our time"".Ned Beatty is perfect as the bumbling Otis who constantly goofs up. I think the only reason Luthor keeps him is that Otis is too dense to be a threat.Valerie Perrine - Lex's va va voom female companion always referred to formally as Miss Teschmacher. Actually, she is pretty kind and smart. One of the funniest scene was when Superman flies through the ceiling sending debris raining down. And Eve Teschmacher just walks calmly away as if oblivious to it all.This package contains three Superman films:* The theatrical version.* The expanded version. Here you get more footage of Marlon Brando's character Jor-El. More on him dealing with the council. You see him explaining to the young Kal-El how to deal with people. Kinds of plugs in the gap about where Superman gets his lessons from. Brando was reportedly paid millions for this. There's also more footage on how Lex tries to destroy Superman.* A vintage 1951 black and white film starring George Reeves has quirky mole men coming out of the ground.Extras include making ofs, director commentary, documentaries, several 1940s cartoons, screen tests (watch Stockard Channing from Grease audition for Lois Lane), a vintage TV special and several audio tracks (close to a CD soundtrack).As a movie, Superman encapsulates drama, comedy, romance and a disaster film all rolled into one. It was very moving at parts. His earth parents found this boy with the outstretched arms and a big smile and raised him as their own. And his father's sudden death when Clark was a teen.One of the most romantic moments in cinematic history was when Superman takes Lois Lane  flying and the song lyrics to Can You Read My Mind was spoken by Lane.And it borrows from the Bible. Superman was sent to earth by his father so that he could help people. Just like Jesus Christ who is the spiritual saviour, Superman is the physical saviour. Just as God cast Satan into hell, the three insurrectionists - General Zod, Ursa and Non are condemned by Jor-El to eternal exile in the Phantom Zone. And is it a coincidence that the infant Kal-El travels to earth in a ship shaped like a star? A reference to The Star of Bethlehem when Christ was born?This movie also runs the constant theme of how aliens are superior to humans. Check out Alien, Predator, Alien Vs Predator, Prometheus and I'm sure there are others.This 1978 version is a tough act to follow and I don't think even the recent Superman Returns can top it.",0.0,0,41,6,96,5,0,3406,585,1,0.1642927547363031,0.0,74.59,56.93,0.18377525792164665,0.0013843059942671068,0.29597451534959274,0.32008502116980747,0.19878089956468606,0.012037580739870817,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,long,

Face it, few other  movies can match the intensity of the narrative, or the credibility of the  characters.  The shark, when it is finally seen, looks rather fake, but the  characters seem real and that is what sells this movie and makes it surpass  the likes of Armageddon. The scene where Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is  being mimicked at the dinner table by his youngest son, the scene where his  wife calms him down about yelling at his older son to get out of a boat,  only to change her mind after looking at a picture in a book Brody was  reading, the scene where 2 fishermen hook a roast &amp; throw it off a dock  to get more than they bargained for, all are strong examples of the  verissimiltude that this movie carries with it.But along with the  characters this movie also boasts scientific accuracy, at least as much as  will be permitted to let the plot function.  Territoriality, for example,  is a theory that has been applied to sharks, but there has also been  evidence to suggest that it is inaccurate.  In general, sharks do not  develop a taste for human flesh.  However, the anecdotes of the shark  experts ring true, &amp; provides insights of their different  personalities--Hooper chuckling over how a shark ripped apart his first  boat &amp; how it fascinated him vs. Quint's chilling narrative of The  Indianapolis.The picture has never been clearer than on this dvd (I  keep odd hours &amp; have roommates, so I must keep the volume down &amp;  therefore will not rate the audio quality)  The documentary is likewise  terrific &amp; makes up for the lack of audio commentary.  Some of the  deleted scenes were used in network broadcasts of the movie, others look  like alternate takes of scenes.  All in all, the only thing I found mildly  disapointing about this movie were the bloopers.  We only get 2.But  still, it's Jaws, the most exciting movie released this year (excepting  North-by-Northwest) whether it be the movie theater or video. And a  quintessential popcorn muncher.

Red's for commies!""","Batman, to the Martian Manhunter: ""I have a $70,000 sliver of radioactive meteor to stop the one from Metropolis. With you, all I need is a penny for a book of matches.""Some SPOILERS here.JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER is the latest from the direct-to-video line of DC Universe Original Animated Movies, being the second offering afterSuperman - Doomsday (DC Universe Animated Original Movie). THE NEW FRONTIER is Warner Brothers' adaptation of Darwyn Cooke's brilliant, critically-acclaimed 2004 two-volumed graphic novel series. And, in fact, Cooke, is on board as a creative consultant. So many chances for him to even more influence the project (this is a good thing).First, a little set-up: After the second world war, things changed in the way that mystery men were perceived by the public and by the government, both having grown fearful and suspicious, thanks to rampant McCarthyism. Buffeted by paranoia, the capes had become unpopular, deemed untrustworthy, and soon fell out of favor altogether. The government's insistence that the superheroes unmask leads to the disbanding of the Justice Society. As the film opens, former JSA members Superman and a growingly disgruntled Wonder Woman had signed loyalty oaths to the American government. Batman hadn't and thus had become a fugitive. And the Hourman is dead.It's 1953 now, and reporter Lois Lane, broadcasting over the Armed Forces radio, heralds the end of the Korean War. And for Air Force fighter pilot Hal Jordan, the news immediately gets him one step closer to his dream of becoming an astronaut. But, then, one tragic, life-altering event throws a wrench into his plans.In a Gotham observatory, a scientist lies crumbled to the floor, expiring of shock and asking forgiveness from the extraterrestrial visitor he had unwittingly brought forth in an attempt to contact the red planet. The Martian Manhunter has come to Earth.Meanwhile, a primordial psychic entity known as the Centre has begun seeping into an ever increasing fragment of the public consciousness. A crazed artist had even created a story about the Centre, before blowing his brains out. On occasion, this malevolent presence had even briefly possessed those it had influenced. The Centre's scheme, when it's finally revealed, will place all of humanity in total jeopardy and will force the mystery men to come out of hiding and once again save the world.I wish JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE NEW FRONTIER had been longer. But what there is of it is pretty terrific. It's told as a period piece, the story set in the backdrop of the 1950s, as racial injustices and xenophobia heavily impacted the American culture. A heads up: this flick is rated PG-13 (there's a suicide, one instance of cussing, and Hal Jordan commits an act which parents maybe shouldn't let their younger kids see). At a running time of 75 minutes, NEW FRONTIER covers a hectic, sprawling span of eight years (1953-1960) in the lives of its characters. DC Comics' Big Three take a back seat as, instead, Hal Jordan, J'onn J'onzz, and Barry Allen (to a lesser extent) do the heavy lifting in terms of focus and onscreen time.So we get to see these three characters develop the most. If there's a leading man in NEW FRONTIER, it'd have to be Hal Jordan. Sucks for me as I'm not really into Jordan (I think he's a bit too smug). However, David Boreanaz, who voices him, goes a long way into making him palatable. Thru the course of the film, we get to learn of Hal's fearlessness and his high regard for human life (traits which would make him the ideal choice as a Green Lantern, which we do see late in the game). Ample time is also given to the stranded Martian, J'onn J'onzz (or John Jones), and his attempts to acclimate to his strange new world. But it's very hard going as he's repeatedly exposed to man's meanness, ignorance, and mindless conformity. When J'onn hears of a space mission to Mars, he jumps at the chance to return home. Meanwhile, the Flash is also spotlighted. The Flash is a newcomer and one of the few superheroes who still does his crimefighting in public. He quickly becomes a target for government agents, who attempt to capture him to see ""what makes him tick."" Also touched on is Flash's feelings of inadequacy in the presence of the more established superheroes. But, no worries, he gets a chance to shine.So, it turns out, the good old days maybe weren't so good. The film does a decent job of reflecting key aspects in the political and cultural climate of the '50s, and of how the DC characters react to these times. When the Flash, having had enough of government persecution, decides to publicly hang it up, he draws snide comments from the man on the street (""And what was with that red costume? Red's for commies!""). I do wish we could've seen more of John Wilson a.k.a. John Henry, a black vigilante whose battles with the Klan ends in tragedy.The retro-style animation is certainly dynamic and is reminiscent of the recent DC animated television shows (BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE). It also closely resembles Darwyn Cooke's clean, nostalgic-style artwork. In fact, certain of the film compositions and imagery are lifted directly from the limited series.The spectacular voice cast is an acting who's who, beginning with David Boreanaz as the daredevil flyboy Hal Jordan. Jeremy Sisto's vibrant voice does Batman a solid (but Kevin Conroy still rules), while Neil Patrick Harris is simply spot on as the Flash. Lucy Lawless (XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS) is a no-brainer as Wonder Woman (there's just a shade of that New Zealand accent). Also here are Brooke Shields (Carol Ferris), Kyra Sedgwick (Lois Lane), Miguel Ferrer (pretty good as the Martian Manhunter), and, surprisingly okay, Kyle MacLachlan as Superman. Oh, and Keith David voices the Centre.Tons of bonus features here, in this 2-disc Special Edition. Disc 1 not only contains the movie but also the in-depth documentary ""Super Heroes United!: The Complete Justice League History."" At 41 minutes, this is a must see for JLA fans as it covers the different periods of DC's premiere superteam. There's an exclusive sneak peek at the upcoming animated DC Universe line's BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT (an anthology supposedly composed of 6 stories and told mostly in manga animation style; think ANIMATRIX). There are 2 audio commentaries, both insightful, one with the animation filmmakers (including Bruce Timm), the other with comic book writer/artist Darwyn Cooke.Disc 2 has the documentary ""The Legion of Doom: The Pathology of the Super Villain"" (which I found boring since I'm not that into the baddies); the 10-minute-long featurette ""Comic Book Commentary: Homage to the New Frontier"" (Darwyn Cooke goes a bit more behind the scenes and talks about stuff in the original mini-series which were left out of the film (the Losers, Ted Grant's last boxing match; the Challengers of the Unknown, etc.)); and 3 bonus Justice League episodes (""Dark Heart,"" ""To Another Shore,"" and the very cool ""Task Force X"").It's not a perfect movie. Superman and King Faraday, for example, come out with hokey battle speeches. And, no doubt, longtime fans will get more of a kick from this film as there are plenty of cameos made by lesser known residents of the DC Universe (the Blackhawks, the Golden Age version of Green Arrow, Adam Strange, etc.). So newcomers or the more casual fans just might spend a busload of time playing the ""Okay, now who's that?"" game. It's a sprawling film, with an abundance of characters. The storytelling in the film's first half tends to be non-linear and is a bit disjointed as various story arcs take turns on camera, none of 'em initially having much to do with one another (with the exception of the Centre thread, which fairly early on impacts the Flash, Batman, and J'onn J'onzz). It's not until the second half that NEW FRONTIER gains a focused narrative drive. And, again, this really needed to be a longer film. So those are my gripes, and, really, compared to what's good and awesome about the film, the negatives are negligible.All hail Bruce Timm and his nerdy posse! There's such an infusion here of that joy in superheroes and in the Golden and Silver Ages of comic books, translating to an exuberant, if dark, picture. It's an action-packed production (check out Flash's run-in with Captain Cold), climaxing in an all-out effort from the heroes as the Centre makes its end move to obliterate humanity. And, by gum, there's dinosaurs! And, to top it all off, this story also paves the way for the eventual forming of the Justice League.If you end up liking this film, then do yourself a favor and check outAbsolute DC: The New Frontier, as well as James Robinson and Paul Smith's excellentJSA: The Golden Age (Elseworlds)and Dan Jolley and Tony Harris'sJSA: The Liberty Files (Justice Society, Elseworlds).Film fun fact: Wonder Woman is significantly taller than Superman.

It's a life's mission... or until I run out of Michelle Yeoh flicks or run out of synonyms for ""beautiful"" and ""fearless"" and ""awesome martial artist"" and ""does her own stunts."" MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS (a.k.a. ""Zhong hua zhan shi."") is from her earlier days, released back in 1987, and it's an uneven period adventure that is ultimately more enjoyable than not. As ever, Michelle Yeoh is in top skull-denting form.I guess I get the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK comparison, what with the setting being circa 1938, what with Michelle Yeoh playing a bold adventurer and brandishing that bullwhip, and then there's the wartime backdrop. But Michelle Yeoh's character, Fok Ming-ming, happens to also be a biplane aviatrix in the early 20th century, and so I'm bringing Tom Selleck's HIGH ROAD TO CHINA into the mix... so there. The plot soon catapults Fok Ming-ming thick into danger and intrigue as she's pressed into patriotic service by her uncle and by some high-ranking military Chinese officer. Her mission involves her flying out to Inner Mongolia, to some remote town called Kaal and there rendezvous with China's top operative Sky Number One. Sky Number One and Fok Ming-ming soon bump into a ruthless Japanese general who has developed a lethal poison gas to use against mainland China, with Kaal projected as the future site of the poison gas factory.Hong Kong cinema has a habit of injecting common denominator comedy into the story line, except that the comedy in MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS is actually a notch above that base level. There are still moments of sheer over-the-top groaners but there are also bits of clever dialogue and situational comedy. Richard Ng's swindler character provides the brunt of comedy relief. He teams up with Fok Ming-ming and Sky Number One to take on the Japanese forces, and when the swindler goes into action, he reminds me a bit of how Bugs Bunny used to do it against Elmer Fudd. Other members of this tiny resistance group consist of the well-meaning but craven governor of Kaal and his kung fu sweetheart.It's nice that even the side characters partake in the fighty fights. But make no mistake, when not being all sunny and charming, Michelle Yeoh assumes the lion's share of the fighting, and she's remarkable again and, as always, she does her own stunts. Not only does she wield a bullwhip like a pro, but she does crazy stuff with a length of rope. Note that the male lead Tung-Shing Yee (Sky Number One) is heroic and dashing, but he's not quite as intrepid as the former Miss Malaysia. Michelle ends up rescuing him a bunch of times. As if that's not enough of a punch to the ego, maybe he shouldn't have told her that his real name is actually ""Lily Wang.""This is during an era when wirework wasn't as advanced and so, even as bodies get tossed thru the air with utter disregard for the laws of gravity, well, you can sometimes see the wire. There are several instances when the story screeches to a standstill as folks keep flapping their lips, and I do think that the plane chase dragged on too long. Going down the home stretch, the tone changes perceptively from breezy escapism to serious wartime drama WITH A MESSAGE. That streak of nationalism gets slathered on pretty thick. So it's a good thing that Michelle Yeoh is ""beautiful"" and ""fearless"" and an ""awesome martial artist"" and ""does her own stunts."" Don't need those synonyms yet.The DVD's bonus stuff offers: an interview with Michelle Yeoh in which she talks about her first film THE OWL VS. BUMBO and of how MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS was the toughest action flick she'd ever made (00:06:57 minutes, in English); an interview with director Tung Wai who offers thoughts on Michelle Yeoh, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Bruce Lee (00:12:51, with English sub-titles); Production Notes which include a synopsis of MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS, Cast & Crew film credits, and Michelle Yeoh's filmography up to MASKED CRUSADER (a.k.a. SILVER HAWK) in 2004; a Michelle Yeoh biography and a so-so photo gallery of her in this movie; a photo gallery from the film (25 photos); the original theatrical trailer (00:04:00 minutes) and the English-dubbed new trailer (00:02:19), both trailers being fairly spoiler-heavy; and original promotional material (the original Hong Kong movie poster and 12 photo stills).",1.0,0,62,10,168,0,0,4406,748,1,0.1827881377881378,-0.3,64.75,61.33,0.1794141118222656,0.0013810919784975023,0.0013738685368918228,0.5651923830202289,0.2526385446421162,0.01407172038129823,0.0002269117313365101,12,4.4,0.0192672,0.5,0.0,,long,

I didn't think we could sink any lower than the 1996 Zeffirelli JE, but this considerably worse. A key aspect of this story is the plainness/roughness of the main characters.  Jane is also meant to be very small due to bad nutrition as a child. Mia Wasikowska is far from homely, and through some trick of the camera, she usually appears 6 feet tall.  She'd have been better cast as Blanche Ingram, for heaven's sake.  Bad casting can usually be gotten around if the story is intact. This thing was little more than a slideshow. Utterly flat.

The majority of the remaining humans now live in a walled city, although there are small bands of humans determined to live on the desert outback outside the city. (To horrifying consequences)One Priest confronts the Pope and his cardinals and tells them that vampires still exist in the outback, although the Pope viciously denies this and ex-communicates the Priest who sets out to find these creatures against the churches will.  His sister and her sheriff husband live in the outback in a small town that has been attacked by the King Vampire and his minions. She is kidnapped.The Priest and the Sheriff try to track them down. What they find out is that the vampires have secured a train to crash through the city gates and attack the humans. The Pope sends three more Priests out to find and kill the renegade Priest.

The show that started it all, the great giant robot epic, the STAR WARS OF JAPAN. And then I watched it. I couldn't believe it. I was actually BORED. The animation was mediocre, the plot, slow, the characters, largely annoying. And don't get me started on the English voice-acting.So you can imagine with what reluctance I purchased the Gundam Movie Trilogy on DVD. And what a surprise it was. Pretty much every complaint I had with the TV show was completely obliterated. The animation, even in the first Gundam movie, looked MUCH nicer. Maybe it was the DVD format, maybe the picture was cleaned up and restored...I don't know. All I know is, the animation looked WAY better. And remember all those redundant scenes (like the Gundam parts switching in mid-air) that were beginning to drive you mad? Gone. Remember those spread-out action scenes that happened just barely often enough to keep you watching? Now they're all part of the same battle, the action escalating and escalating until you're practically hyperventilating. And glory be, the characters seem more fully fleshed out too. And the plot improvements? A bit like replacing ""What are midichloreans?"" (hope I spelled that right) with ""The force is what gives a Jedi his power."" The sound effects, speech, and music were redone for the dvds as well. No words can describe the difference. What was cheesy or fake now sounds awesome. I kid you not.Zeon Strikes BackThese DVDs do have one or two downsides. First, they're not exactly cheap. Secondly, there's almost no extras at all. No trailers, no making of documentary, no commentary. Nothing. And third, there's no English version of the speech. Now I can deal with that, but I really wish they had gone through the trouble to record a good English version of these movies. It really would have been the icing on the cake.Then of course there is a bit of a boring lag in between the first and third Gundam movies. I know, I know, we get more insight into the characters and their motivations in the second movie. But compared to the gripping drama of the first and third movies (not to mention the awesome rivalry between Char and Amuro) the second movie is a bit slow-moving. For the movie with Char and Amuro on the cover, you'd think there would be more of the cool Amuro vs. Char action. Oh, well.Return of the NewtypeLet's face it, great animation doesn't hurt. Great music and sound effects enhance everything. Good voice-acting helps a lot too. But what really makes for an engaging Mecha Saga is plot, action, and characterization. It's awful hard to get hooked when you don't care about the characters, the plot is boring and the action is comatose. Foretunately, the third Gundam movie delivers in these all-important ways, and features the best animation of the three movies as well.In the third Gundam movie, everything comes to a head. Sayla confronts Char. Char and Amuro have a showdown. Mirai tries to decide who she loves. Complications of war and emotional turmoil tears at everyone. And every time you think the last battle is over, the action gets even more intense. It quite literally blew me away. In short, the Gundam movies succeed in every way.If you loved the show, buy the movies. If you hated the show, buy the movies. If you love anything Gundam, buy the movies. These movies have a priviledged place on my shelf, ahead of Gundam Wing, Martian Successor Nadesico, and even the awesome Macross Saga. I can give no higher recommendation.",0.8636363636363636,3,28,4,130,4,0,3610,620,1,0.11086927475816362,0.35714285714285715,76.93,50.5,0.20041140155360848,0.12083632136395248,0.2525575831966106,0.0010989784538408699,0.42509571543198754,0.00775623268698061,0.0002391681981823217,2,5.0,0.0,0.8260869565217391,2.590909090909091,,long,

Both films have three plots: one about Jack Irish's life, his relationship with friends, and the women who are sexually attracted to him; a second focusing on his involvement with two men in fixing bets on races to win large sums of money; and a third where he tries to help people he knows and is nearly killed. The films are based on the award-winning books by Peter Temple.The plots are very enjoyable and suspenseful; Guy Pearce as Jack Irish is charismatic and likeable; his acting is superb; and the actors who play smaller parts add much that is positive to the drama. The problem with the film - but perhaps it is only my family and me - is that we had difficulty understanding the Australian speech. However, once we turned on the English subtitles, we had no problem, and we did not find the subtitles distracting.Irish, the film shows, was an accomplished criminal lawyer whose wife, who he loved very much, is shot dead. He gives up his law practice and sex in the first film, helps in fixing horse-race betting, and over-indulges in alcohol. Just before giving up his law practice, when he began drinking, he lost a case of vehicular manslaughter. Now, sometime later, he feels guilty about his mishandling of the case, and decides to find out who actually killed the woman. In the second film, he meets a friend of his dead father who needs his help in finding his prodigal son.Irish finds out in both films - as do viewers - that what first appeared as facts, is not so.",0.5,2,45,5,45,0,0,1574,281,1,0.12813976499690782,0.25,64.95,15.64,0.03536763361418056,0.0024685955265097664,0.002429592372232923,0.9572948405747199,0.002439337912356878,0.028589580686149935,0.00031746031746031746,4,4.333333333333333,0.0740448,0.4,1.0,,long,

Two Americans find a peculiar kind of romance in Tokyo, shuffling from their hotel rooms to the hotel lounge to a night on the town. No matter where they go, there's a sense of loneliness. After all, they are both leaving soon, so there's no way they establish anything permanent while they're together. It's an ironic moment for both characters.All of this stuff --- the mood, the characters' feelings, and their actions --- is filmed at the pace of real life. It's unlike  most films, where the boring parts of life are ditched, leaving only the exciting stuff. It's as if the director wanted to take a close look at being bored and out of place. That's not everyone's idea of a good time at the movies, so this film had received a mixed reaction.But it's worth a look --- or maybe two. Underneath it all, it's a romantic comedy.

No, picture and audio are both great. So many complaints because of how it was edited. Yes, Steve Harris did a lot of fast editing throughout to give the concert a fast-paced look. If you're epileptic, it can be bothersome. But don't let it discourage you from buying this or Rock In Rio (also edited by Harris). I've owned and viewed many concert dvds from Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Judas Priest, Slayer, Testament, Overkill, Kreator, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Lamb Of God, Arch Enemy, Nevermore, Opeth, Dream Theater, Killing Joke, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Killswitch Engage, Exodus, Slipknot, Machine Head, etc. I've never worried about how editing was gonna make a concert look on dvd. There's only one thing I really worry about, and that's sound quality. I figure that a great live dvd depends on how great it sounds especially at a high volume. This can even determine, whether or not you'd want to buy a cd version of it if it's available. Back to the review, the editing is not as bad as it sounds according to others. It eventually slows down a little, enough for you to catch your breath. When it does, you can enjoy seeing members including Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, and Janick Gers doing their best as the three guitarists in the band. It would have been nice to have a few more classics in the tracklist, but with it already being 16 tracks long, I'll take it. Extras are great to watch, especially the Death On The Road documentary on the making of Dance Of Death and the tour behind it. I'd recommend this even to a new fan.

This DVD has no sub-titles (not required) and is only 107 minutes (short by Bollywood standards).Marigold the movie was a fresh experience for me, and got me hooked on pure Bollywood movies (I lean towards the traditional type Bollywood musical movie - the color, music, many beautiful women dancing, and ""typically"" intense love stories that don't rely on physical/naked love scenes).Ali Larter is great in Marigold (the lead actress), who's Character undergoes a significant personality transformation due to her exposure to people in India (the first 15 minutes of the movie are kind of harsh because she plays a spoiled actress to the hilt, but she won me over 'big time' in the remaining events).  Salman Khan (the lead actor) is a very successful Indian actor, who plays his part low key in this film.There are several good dance scenes with good music, but this is not a typical American musical so be prepared for a difference.

Sean Bean is Richard Sharpe, a dashing, swashbuckling hero in the Napoleonic Wars.

Events transpire that convince Sharpe he must capture an Imperial Eagle, the standard of Napoleon's army, and touched by ""Boney"" himself. Of course, there's no shortage of lovely ladies, either, with Theresa (played by Assumpta Serna) and Josefina (Katia Caballero), a lady in a compromised position whom Sharpe gallantly rescues.The cast are quite enjoyable in this one, with Brian Cox as the conniving but genuninely nice Major Hogan, Daragh O'Malley as the loyal but fiery Sgt. Patrick Harper, and Michael Cochrane in a brilliant turn as the really, really, really *nasty* Henry Simmerson.

The reviews were unanimously positive from the critics and it was a huge hit around the world.Doris  Day has never looked better.  She was dressed to the nines by Jean Louis,  wore smart hair styles and gave an Oscar nominated performance as Best  Actress.  Rock Hudson was surprisingly effective as Brad Allen, her rival  partyline user.The plot is cat and mouse and set the tone for the other  Day/Hudson films featuring mistaken identity and deceit.  As usual, the  supporting plays are sterling. Tony Randall deserved a best supporting  actor nod, but didn't get one.  He was superb.  I loved the great Thelma  Ritter (nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Day's tipsy maid, Alma, and  Nick Adams was appropriately over-sexed as Tony the Harvard man who tries  to seduce Miss Day.  Lee Patrick, as Tony's mother, was the same as she was  in all of her films, zanny, and Julia Meade was fun as one of Hudson's  &quot;regulars&quot;.The picture is bright, witty and beautifully  produced.

And the only Hannibal"" I ever knew (from the stories 248-183 BC) that amounted to something, was a Carthaginian who marched his army including elephants into and conquered Rome and occupied it during the First Punic Wars. But this film captured my attention. Maybe it was because I synapsed many of my neurons in earlier years at a practice of medicine, but I had to watch this film four times to finally figure out each piece, i.e., the changing of the handgun, how he did it at the house as he was being arrested and subdued, and a few other parts.I thought for a relative newcomer Ryan Gosling did an extremely good job. Sure, parts of the film were created: the legal issues you had to believe; but other parts of the film were done very well. Anthony Hopkins did a good job as I see it, as an aircraft accident investigator though likely this would be handled in real-life by the NTSB (though a privately-sought rendition could be sought by an interested concern, though they are not inexpensive). The description of the entry wound and he path of the finally resting bullet were accurately described, as well as the residual compromise of the motor and other functions.The ending was not particularly surprising, but I would have like to have seen what was said at opening arguments at the second trial. I suppose that might have diminished the many other legal foibles noted and pointed out already. Altogether, I find this among the top five of the maybe two hundred plus films I have seen this year.

After affirming that he has finally gotten Ian and Barbara back home, the TARDIS crew step out and soon realize they are in France.  A quick investigation in an abandoned farmhouse gives them the time period, during the Reign of Terror.They find that it's not a really nice place to be.  Susan, Barbara, and Ian are captured by Revolutionary soldiers and sent to the Conciergere Prison in Paris.  The Doctor runs afoul of an oafish overseer in charge of some tax-evaders doing manual labour, and his trips across the countryside have some nice accompanying incidental music.  The jailer in the Conciergere would be the last person to get a Red Cross service medal or be canonized for sainthood.  Yet the prison governor, Lemaitre, is curious about Ian, who is imprisoned with a wounded and dying English prisoner named Webster, who gives him a secret message concerning a secret agent in France named James Stirling.Yet it's the dingy cells and unpleasant characters such as the soldiers, the jailer, and overseer, who effectively add to the period detail.Not everybody appears to be from the dregs of humanity, though.  Jules and Jean, in the manner of The Scarlet Pimpernel, are two rebels who stage raids, rescuing prisoners who have appointments to keep with Madame Guillotine.  As an example of honorable humanity, he tells Barbara and Susan regarding their separated comrades, &quot;I shall not rest until the four of you are together again.&quot;The Doctor has some real fun with his regional deputy uniform, complete with feathered hat, cloak, and epaulets, which he appropriates to rescue his friends.Episodes 4 and 5, &quot;The Tyrant Of France&quot; and &quot;A Bargain Of Necessity&quot;, are missing, but Carole Ann Ford (Susan) fills in the blanks as Nicholas Courtney did for The Invasion.  Apart from her narration, there are photo stills, recordings from the soundtrack, and some moving footage.  This is where Robespierre finally comes out.There are some continuity errors.  Webster, the dying prisoner in Ian's cell, tells him to go to the Chien Gris inn, yet later, Ian remembers it as The Sinking Ship (Vaisseau Qui Coule).  Chien Gris means Grey Dog in French.  Also, Napoleon's role in Robespierre's overthrow is historically inaccurate;  at least they get Paul Barras's role more or less correct.  Despite Robespierre not controlling the Terror, he is made as the chief villain here.However, the spirit of adventure and knowledge is maintained in the Doctor's speech to his crew at the end of the story, in a voice over amid a starry sky:  &quot;Our lives are important-at least to us-and as we see, so we learn... Our destiny is in the stars, so let's go and search for it...&quot;The second tape contains the surviving episodes of two Patrick Troughton stories, episodes 1 and 3 of the 6-part The Faceless Ones, set at Gatwick Airport, and involving aliens kidnapping passengers using Chameleon Tours as a front.  But for additional knowledge, this story is the last story of Ben and Polly.  And Samantha Briggs is played by Pauline Collins, best known as Sarah in Upstairs Downstairs.  She's very plucky here.  There's also Episode 1 and a few brief clips from The Web Of Fear, which feature a return of the robot Yeti.

At least they are organized by category - other than that - there are NO references to When these were made - not even a year. No history - just here are a bunch of commercials. Not much of a menu - and when I select one category - it automatically goes to the following one afterwards - without announcing what it is.The commercials are a mixture of black and white and color. My main beef is No one did ANY restoration. Some commercials are crystal clear - while others are so blurry - I could barely make them out.There are indeed some fun ones to see - Flintstones and other classics.I would have loved if there were some sort of alternate audio - hearing commentary about the times and situations. Who did the voice overs. I picked this up for about $5.00 - and it might be worth that much.I'm sure some people did a lot to get all these commercials together - but they didn't finish the job of adding ANY information - if is up to the viewer to know the history.I would prefer a documentary about the history of TV commercials - and how they evolved.

It was released just in time to benefit from intense interest in the courtroom stand off between Woody and Mia over Woody's relationship with Mia's adopted daughter, Soon-Yi. Not to say that this was a calculated career move, but the film did better at the box office than any of his other films. It offered uncanny parallels into the real life drama, but it also differed in many respects. Still, it was weird how life imitated art, or vice versa.As the opening credits roll, we hear a vintage recording of Cole Porter's ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" The first scene shows Creative Writing Professor Gabe Roth (Woody Allen) watching a documentary on Einstein where the great thinker is quoted saying ""God doesn't throw dice with the universe."" Gabe quips, ""No, he only plays Hide & Seek.""Gabe and Judy Roth (Mia Farrow) are going to dinner with another married couple, Jack (Sydney Pollack) and Sally (Judy Davis). They arrive and announce they are separating before going out for Chinese food. Judy is the most upset, but Jack and Sally claim it was a mutual decision, and they are fine with it. Meanwhile Gabe, who is a writing professor, is becoming interested in one of his students (Juliette Lewis). Jack starts seeing an aerobics instructor (Lysette Anthony), and Sally tries to date, but they both become extremely jealous of each other when they find out they're seeing other people. Judy has set up Sally with a colleague, (Liam Neeson) who is interested in her, but Sally is now too preoccupied with her husband to notice. Judy regrets setting Sally up, because she is starting to fall for him herself.The only gimmick used in this film is a kind of documentary style, with wobbly hand held camera, sometimes following characters as they dart from the room, barely catching a glimpse as they leave. Some shots are purposely obscured, to give it a gritty look, as if you are a casual observer, or a fly-on-the-wall. Other times characters are grilled by an off camera voice--presumably their analyst--giving them a chance to reveal their innermost thoughts talking directly to the camera. This technique is now used on the sit com The Office, by the way.As a rumination on Married Life, a response to Cole Porter's question, what is this thing called love? Woody is surprisingly insightful. Sally and Jack have the ring of truth, especially when they are responding with jealousy. Great performances by Judy Davis and Sydney Pollack. Mia is great and believable as Judy Roth, and Liam Neeson plays his part well. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Gabe's young student, Rain.My only quibble is with Woody's character, Gabe Roth. I feel like Woody, as writer and director, deliberately stacked the deck, almost as if he was already preparing his defense for the upcoming Soon-Yi showdown. He has every reason to justify a fling with Rain, but the most he will allow himself is a kiss in the rain. Like, he COULD have had a fling with her, but he CHOSE not to. Even though her parents idolize him for his writing, and practically beg him to go to her birthday party, and she has already had a string of older lovers, culminating in her therapist, who confronts Gabe as he drops her off prior to meeting her parents. He asks him if he seduces all of his students, giving Gabe the chance to squirm uncomfortably, playing the innocent martyr. This scene was made even creepier by a slight misunderstanding and confusion of mine--that I thought Juliette Lewis was Rachel Griffiths, because Rain's therapist was played by Ron Rifkin, who plays Rachel's Uncle Saul on the television show: Brothers & Sisters.But Juliette Lewis is great as Rain, named after poet Rainer Maria Rilke by her poetry lovin' mom (Blythe Danner). The student/teacher exchanges function as a parody of Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet. She is just talented enough to justify Gabe's interest, while blinded by his mid-life infatuation, and she has the good sense to lose Gabe's novel in a taxi cab. Plus, she looks great in her Catholic School Girl pleated plaid skirt.Rain: I spent five days searching for the perfect word to describe the husband and that's when I came up with ""apucious"".Gabe: Apucious. I looked it up in the dictionary but I couldn't find it.Rain: Yeah, I know. I made it up.Gabe: Oh, really.Rain: Yeah. I thought it described him perfectly.Though neither character's writing is actually very good, the script and writing of Husbands and Wives is another story--apart from the one ""aupucious"" lapse due to Woody's need to rationalize and justify his own ""aupucious"" lapse.Some other films by Woody Allen Featuring Mia Farrow (with fun facts and trivia courtesy of imdb dot com):A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy(1982) Woody Allen wrote the role of Ariel for Diane Keaton, but she couldn't take the part because she was busy promoting her film Reds (1981) and preparing for Alan Parker's Shoot the Moon (1982). The first time Woody Allen appeared in one of his own films as part of an ensemble cast. Prior to this, he was either the main character or not in the film at all. The first time Mia Farrow appeared in a Woody Allen film. Woody Allen wrote the screenplay in 2 weeks.Zelig(1983) To create authenticity, the production used actual lenses, cameras and sound equipment from the 1920s, and used the exact same lighting that would have been done. In addition, 'Gordon Willis' took the exposed negatives to the shower, and stomped on them. In order to help create the look of genuine footage from the 1930s, DuArt, the lab that handled processing, called some of their experienced technicians (who were experienced with processing techniques of the 1930s) out of retirement.Broadway Danny Rose(1984) The reason Mia Farrow wears sunglasses most of the film is that Woody Allen did not feel she could pass herself as a tough Italian ""broad"", so he had her wear the sunglasses most of the film to hide her eyes, making her seem more sultry and mysterious. The only time she removes the sunglasses is when her character is supposed to be more vulnerable.The Purple Rose of Cairo(1985) Woody Allen has said more than once that this is his favorite of the movies he's made. After this film was previewed, word got back to Woody Allen that if he just changed his ending, he could have a big hit. Allen declined, saying that the ending is one of the reasons he made the film. In an interview in Esquire, Woody Allen was asked why he didn't make a happy ending to the film. Allen replied, ""That *was* the happy ending.""Hannah and Her Sisters(1986) Many of Hannah's scenes were filmed in Mia Farrow's actual apartment. Allen said that Farrow once had the eerie experience of turning on the TV to a chance broadcast of the movie thus viewing her own apartment on TV while she was sitting in it. According to USA Today, upon the film's original release, a movement was afoot to try to make Allen's script the first screenplay to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The poem Eliot gives Lee which contains the line ""nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"", is the poem ""somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond"", by e.e. cummings. The book of poems by e.e. cummings is entitled ?Complete Poems 1913 ? 1962?, and the poem ?Somewhere? is on page 366. With a box office gross of over $40 million, this film represented Woody Allen's most financially successful film until Match Point (2005) in 2005. Four of Mia Farrow's real-life children appear in this film. Two appear as Hannah's son and daughter in the movie, while the other two (including Soon-Yi Previn, who Woody Allen would eventually marry in 1997) appear as young guests in the Thanksgiving scenes.Radio Days(1987) This is the only Woody Allen film in which both of his frequent collaborators and longtime companions Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton appear.September(1987) Director Woody Allen cast and shot this film twice, without telling the original cast. Woody Allen decided to make the film for two main reasons. One was because he had always wanted to do a ""chamber piece"", a film with a small cast (there are only six principal characters, and only nine in the entire film) in a single location. The other was for the location itself, Mia Farrow's Connecticut country house, which inspired Woody Allen to write the screenplay with the intention that it would be shot at the house. Unfortunately, by the time Allen finished the screenplay, it was winter and the location was unusable for a movie so firmly planted in September. The entire movie (which takes place in Vermont) was shot on a single soundstage at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. According to Mia Farrow's autobiography ""What Falls Away"", Woody Allen filmed two or three versions of every scene, took all of the footage into the editing suite, cut the film together and then decided that he hated it. He then rewrote the entire script, fired and recast virtually every major part, and re-filmed the entire thing. This meant that he doubled his production costs and came in well behind schedule. Allen was reportedly keen to do it all againAnother Woman(1988) Originally Mia Farrow was supposed to have played the part of Marion but her real-life pregnancy prevented that. Gena Rowlands took the part instead.Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) One third of the film had Woody Allen's character shooting a documentary on old vaudevillians, with Mia Farrow as the head of the institute to which they belonged. Allen didn't like the scenes in the final cut. During postproduction he cut an entire third of the film, then rewrote and re-shot the third of the film from scratch. As a result, Sean Young's scenes were cut out, and Daryl Hannah's role was reduced to a brief cameo.New York Stories Segment: ""Oedipus Wrecks"" (1989) At 33 minutes, Francis Ford Coppola's segment is the shortest. Woody Allen's clocks in at 40 minutes, while Scorsese's runs to 45 minutes. The performance piece that Steve Buscemi delivers in the Martin Scorsese segment was conceived and written by the actor himself. Jessie Keosian, who plays Aunt Ceil in the Woody Allen segment, ""Oedipus Wrecks,"" was Allen's high school biology teacher. They had not met since high school until the audition for this film.Alice(1990) His role as Dr. Yang was the final film role for Keye Luke. He died only weeks after this film was released.Shadows and Fog(1992) Based on a one-act comedy play called ""Death"", published in Woody Allen's ""Without Feathers"" (1972), the play and movie are themselves a pastiche of Franz Josef Kafka's work in general, and of his novel ""The Trial"" in particular. Reminds me of this scene from Annie Hall:Pam: Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience.Alvy Singer: Oh. Thank you.Pam: I mean that as a compliment.Husbands and Wives (1992) Hoping to piggyback on the scandal surrounding Woody Allen's break-up with Mia Farrow, TriStar opened the film on 865 screens, the largest amount ever given over to a Woody Allen picture. They were rewarded with an opening weekend of $3.52 million, the biggest ever for an Allen film. Woody Allen said in an interview that the reason he shot the film the way he did was that he wanted to break the usual rules of filmmaking. He cut scenes right in the middle of dialog, he used hand held cameras for no particular reason and did not care if he showed the side or the back of a performer's head during a scene. Allen said for this reason, he felt this film was one of his best. Sydney Pollack stated that although he liked working on the film, he did not like the character he played. Contrary to general perception, Mia Farrow's role is not autobiographical. Indeed, Woody Allen originally wrote the Judy Davis part with the idea of Farrow playing it. Farrow chose to take on the role of Gabe's wife instead as it meant less shooting time for her.",0.8333333333333334,1,41,9,414,7,0,11933,2043,1,0.177053788335434,0.0,69.21,87.72,0.058827277100974434,0.0004204319161492717,0.0004191516433000986,0.7724665757726795,0.16786656356689672,0.003435850163412386,6.982850120105022e-05,5,3.6666666666666665,0.0082944,0.7142857142857143,0.8333333333333334,2.0,long,

I think the title of this film plays off that. It is really about Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster), as if she were on trial, as if she were the accused. It was a very difficult role, considering all she had to go through, and then two grueling trials on top of that. As an actress Foster would have to walk a very fine line. She was sexy, flirtatious, and very drunk and high, but did she deserve to be raped? Jodie Foster was quite the brave one. She dared to take her character to the very edge of the abyss, where the jury--not to mention the audience--is almost thinking that she was asking for it.After the men who raped her are put away, but with very light sentences for ""reckless endangerment,"" Attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) puts the men who watched and cheered the rapists on trial. Though there is no ""Good Samaritan"" law, that would make it illegal to witness a crime and do nothing, there is a law against ""criminal solicitation"" encouraging a crime. It was a very unusual interpretation of the law by Sarah's attorney; and one that the D.A. Paul Rudolph vehemently disapproved of. Kelly McGillis portrayed Murphy's change of heart well. By giving the men a chance to plea bargain, she was de facto admitting that she thought her case was weak. She is really going out on a limb with her unusual prosecution, but that is the only way they can get it on record that a rape had occurred so the rapists will serve out their maximum sentences.--------------Sarah Tobias: What are our chances?Kathryn Murphy: 50-50 at the most. Good night.Sarah Tobias: Good night.====================Jodie Foster was great as Sarah Tobias, and she won an Oscar for her performance. A very well deserved Oscar. Foster has been acting since she was a child. I recall seeing one of her first film performances as a tom boy named Audrey in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" She continued to impress, holding her own as Iris against Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver."" Since ""The Accused"" she has won another Oscar for ""The Silence of The Lambs.""Leo Rossi deserves mention for his portrayal of Cliff Albrecht, one of the men on trial for cheering and egging on the rapists. With his beady eyes and scorpion tattoo he oozed menace. He really threw himself into his role with relish. There is a great scene where he recognizes Sarah in a record store that serves as a catalyst for all that follows.I find ""The Accused"" guilty. Guilty of being a gripping court room drama--and one of the best performances of Jodie Foster's illustrious career. It is not to be missed, and I sentence one and all to watch it, in spite of the dark and heavy material. Objection overruled.-----------------------Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrecht: [to Sarah Tobias] Hey, wanna play pinball?==========================Nell(1994) Jodie Foster was NellThe Silence of the Lambs (Widescreen Special Edition)(1991) Jodie Foster was Clarice StarlingMade In Heaven(1987) Kelly McGillis was Annie Packert/Ally ChandlerTop Gun(1986) Kelly McGillis was CharlieWitness(1985) Kelly McGillis was Rachel LappReuben, Reuben(1983) Kelly McGillis was Geneva SpoffordCarny(1980) Jodie Foster was DonnaFoxes(1980) Jodie Foster was JeanieTaxi Driver(1976) Jodie Foster was IrisAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore(1974) Jodie Foster was Audrey--------------D.A.

Take out 'The Thin Red Line' and add  in 'The Truman Show', and the Academy would have actually gotten the top  lineup right.'The Truman Show' is an exceptional movie, partly because  it could have gone so wrong. The premise could easily come across as some  episode off of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and &quot;everybody&quot;  knows that Jim Carrey in the lead role makes this a comedy. Well, it didn't  turn out that way.Jim Carrey, in this movie, shows (once again) that he  can do some excellent dramatic acting. His character has traces of Jim's  wacko roles from the earlier movies that so many viewers define him by, but  this works. Truman Burbank has been raised in a totally unnatural  environment, and Jim Carrey shows the damage that this has caused in the  character. He is like a bomb which can go off at any second, and which does  go off during the course of the movie.Similarly, the rest of the movie  succeeds by walking just at the edge of ludicrousness. The very careful  handling of the story by director Peter Weir, and the restrained  performance of Ed Harris and the rest of the cast keeps us at the very edge  of our suspension of disbelief. The story is bizarre, but just within the  realm of possibility for your mind to accept. The result is like an episode  of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, directed by Frank Kapra.",0.0,0,51,12,49,0,0,1454,254,1,0.21111904761904765,0.705,68.6,111.07,0.0027231812080633104,0.2269837275969546,0.297283854409352,0.4702605467794632,0.0027486900061667995,0.035075653370013754,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.5,long,

I was impressed with the archival footage, still photographs and interviews with just a few of the people who were there the night that GLBTQ people finally refused to be bullied by police and ""the establishment."" Up until the Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969, gays, lesbians, bisexual, transgender people and those questioning their sexuality were routinely subjected to humiliating, brutal punishments for simply being ""caught"" in a gay bar--they were arrested as the bar was raided and their names and addresses were published in local newspapers! They were frequently ruined for life; they often lost their jobs as a result of being arrested for ""homosexual (and other) acts"" because the papers made it very public that they had committed what was then just about the most horrible, shameful and indecent crime you could commit. Indeed, it's chilling to see footage of a law enforcement officer barking at a group of young students that if they were involved in any same-sex activity or similar relationships they ""would find out about it and you'll be caught--we'll tell your parents"" and more! Those poor students looked scared to death. There was even a ""Dachau for queers"" called The Atascadero State Hospital in California where staff injected ""sexual deviants"" with a drug designed to make them feel they were drowning in an effort to ""cure them.""Some of the most poignant footage is the interviews we get with several people who were actually at The Stonewall Bar that evening--they tell how the Mafia routinely ran the gay bars and paid off the cops to either stay away or raid the bars at pre-arranged times. These eye-witnesses also tell of just how big the crowd of angry people became after The Stonewall was raided unexpectedly and how violence broke out--this was the first time police had ever seen this reaction from the gays, lesbians, drag queens and others on their side. We find out what happened after more police arrived; the complete story of what transpired that evening is fascinating. We learn in great detail how the GLBTQ community resisted police all through that night. There is even interview time with a police office who was there the night the bar was raided.The DVD doesn't come with bonus features; but then again it doesn't have to. The story is told with such clarity and detail that almost nothing, if anything, is left out.Overall, I highly recommend this film for anyone in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning community; and it's clearly essential viewing for anyone studying the history of human rights and civil rights. We must remember The Stonewall Uprising so that younger generations of people will know about the birth of what was to become the global GLBTQ equal rights movement.",0.6666666666666666,1,17,2,73,0,2,2825,467,1,0.09340909090909091,0.0,50.3,-6.7,0.20602333178852614,0.00210999290800836,0.0020940315205822593,0.6902251852619349,0.09954745852094829,0.006017699115044248,0.00023590469450342062,5,4.5,0.0575424,0.5,0.6666666666666666,,long,

My only complaint was the scene in which Chan is riding to the mansion that the inventor was killed in, and is walking up to the mansion. Loud, blaring, music is played during this scene as if there was a fight scene going on or something. But it is apparent that Toler is trying to create interest in this new first Monogram outing, and it pays off. The low budget is futile to complain about, because the budget for the Monogram pictures never increases at any point in time. Critics should judge the Monogram Chans and state their opinion according to if they did the best job they could with the lower  budget. Simply complaining about the low budget doesn't cut it, because the Monogram Chans ALL have a low budget. But if their resources are used in the best way, it can still be a good movie, low budget or not.I thought it was a good mystery that was not muddled or confusing. I would give them a thumbs up for doing their best to have a good movie. The Fox Chans were a hard act to follow, but quite a few times, Monogram did very well, lower budget and all. Of course, Benson Fong did not have the effect that the other two previous sons had, but he did well, I thought. Marianne Quon as Iris Chan works well off Benson Fong, but is only seen in this one movie. And of course, Mantan Moreland as Birmingham makes his first appearance as well, and continued throughout the series(with the exception of &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Money&quot;.)Of course, this movie is not &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, but is worth viewing.",1.0,0,27,5,54,0,0,1644,296,1,0.18235581622678398,0.25,78.08,100.24,0.0025844025105254296,0.002566201251663688,0.29906563984950935,0.0025840659953722165,0.6931996903929293,0.016423357664233577,0.0006079027355623101,1,,0.0,0.9444444444444444,0.0,,long,

The narrative concerns a conventional, middle class, married couple who conspire to take a weekend trip to kill the wife's parents for money.The car trip taken by the couple is comprised of a series of disastrous, improbable, and perplexing events. Art terrorists, thieves, rapists, and Marxist revolutionaries assail the couple at all turns. France is being overrun by weirdos! Bloody, flaming car (and plane!) crashes are everywhere. Violent demise is at every turn.In the movie is a famous traffic jam scene that employed what was, up until the time of this movie's making, the longest dolly ever made. The scene is absurd, comical, and one of the delights of the movie. Likewise, Godard was becoming interested in socialist politics at this time in his career, in light of the Vietnam war and anti-colonial struggles that were happening globally, so a lot of ""revolutionary"" ideas are expressed by characters in the film. Unfortunately Godard most often has people simply read manifestos to the camera. Godard's political interests are thus conveyed in an awkward, cumbersome way. You do not have to agree with they're saying in order to enjoy the film.Having said that, the movie is still one hell of a ride -- no pun intended. The bourgeois couple at the heart of the story don't care about the flaming chaos around them. They just want their money. At one point the husband even sits idly by as a stranger rapes his wife.As a journey narrative of two people, WEEKEND (or is it WEEK END?)is reminiscent of Alejandro Jodorwosky's 1968 FANDO & LIS. (There was something in the water in the late 60s.) Like Fando & Lis, Weekend is mainly a series of segments or vignettes strung together over the course of two protagonists' quest. In Fando & Lis's case the couple's uest is for the fabled City of Tar; in Weekend's case it's for an ample inheritance.The last 30 minutes are the best in the film, as well as the most graphic. Comparisons to Pasolini's SALO or even John Waters's PINK FLAMINGOS may come to mind. In short, the bourgeois couple are kidnapped by mod-ish looking radical militants who look as if they've all come from an MC5 concert. One disturbing scene shows the actors actually slaughtering a duck and a pig on camera. The ducks headless neck suirts blood as its body twitches and its wings flap. The pig struggles as its throat is slit in front of the camera. Of course, people kill pigs and fowl everyday -- it's how a lot of folks are supplied with their favorite meals. What could possibly be wrong with showing it, Godard almost seems to ask?But the radicals also, it turns out, like to literally eat the rich, too. One uncomfortable scene portrays a victim stripping naked, being killed, and then being prepared for a meal as a cook cracks two eggs over her lifeless body and then thrusts a fish into her vagina (not shown on camera). Finally, the bourgeois husband is killed and is served up with the pig meat. The wife, who seems to have accepted the militants' way of life at this point, dines on her husband's and the pig's flesh as the movie ends.Not for everyone, but some sort of remarkable milestone in cinema. Chaotic, dangerous, transgressive, and never boring.The version of WEEK END I saw was the PAL version, which featured a great transfer, nice lucid colors, and special features that included an interview with Godard cinematographer Raoul Coutard, who is actually quite humorous and likeable as he sheds light on the circumstances surrounding the making of the movie. (""Godard was in a bad mood most of the time he was making the film, hence all the car crashes,"" ""Godard wanted to piss off the producer with this scene,"" etc., to paraphrase.)",0.75,7,23,4,132,2,2,3800,656,1,0.05011446886446887,0.5,71.44,75.88,0.09908276109794491,0.0012871605735874107,0.028042406504974807,0.45786428330889467,0.4137233885145983,0.0060526315789473685,0.0001973164956590371,1,,0.0,0.7241379310344828,5.25,,long,

I had series one given to me as a birthday present and watched the complete series in on one rainy afternoon. Reggie is in a job he hates and commutes by train to his office daily during which time he has fantacy's about his fellow train travelers in fact Reggie has them about almost everyone. I could not wait to see if ther was a second series at last after a long wait it was released with series one so I bought the set and have passed on series one to a friend. I must not spoil too much of the storylines as they are so much fun. Written with a great deal of comic flair and a total understanding of what most men think this is a winner .

Some of these were liberties taken by the filmmakers that could not, and cannot, be reversed (Arwen instead of Glorfindel, Aragorn's leaving of Anduril in Rivendell, etc.). However, this extended ""director's cut"" has fixed quite a few of the earlier edit's annoyances. Though I loved the original film despite the occasional niggle, this expanded version FEELS more like Tolkien. The pace is less rushed (even though the first film was very long itself), and there are considerably more character moments. Gimli and Boromir are the most notable improvements. Boromir was always excellently developed (even more so now), but Gimli, as a character, was very weak. In fact, Gimli's portrayal as seen by the original cut was a severe disappointment, as Gimli is one of my favorite characters, and he had been reduced to a surly complainer who seemed to lack all but the most basic of emotions. Now, however, Gimli feels more like Gimli, thanks to his moments with Galadriel and Haldir in Lothlorien. One of the best new scenes, however, involves Sam and Frodo, as they spy a troupe of Elves departing Middle Earth. Almost every second of added footage is completely worthwhile. This stuff isn't just for fans of the novels, though - the added scenes make for a more coherent and heartfelt picture (and a slightly more violent one as well). My only real beef with the extended version is that it spans the course of TWO discs, which brings with it the annoyance of exchanging when one has ended. Add to this new and improved Fellowship a whole horde of previously unseen features and you have the ultimate Fellowship of the Ring presentation. Tolkien fans and fans of the films should not pass this one up under any circumstances.",0.0,0,40,8,61,0,0,1924,334,1,0.18302128427128428,0.75,65.86,105.66,0.4024317100652223,0.0027976495198040615,0.0027902162026293355,0.3437234373997309,0.2482569868126135,0.02079002079002079,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.444444444444445,long,

Lynley and Havers have grown into an instinctive and highly effective parternship.  A subtle and unspoken emotional dependence on each other complicates their work together but carries them through the challenge of the four tough murder mysteries in this series.""In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner"" takes Lynley to the North of England to investigate the murder of the daughter of a retired vice cop.  An excess of suspects gives Lynley an excuse to summon the deskbound Havers to assist.  The murder victim turns out to have a hidden life and a number of enemies.  Havers and Lynley will pursue parallel trails of clues to a surprising finish.""A Traitor To Memory"" focuses on the murder of the long-missing mother of a world class violinist suddenly struck with stage fright.  In addition to the challenge of the case itself, Lynley suspects a possible coverup by his boss DSI Webberly and fears a disgruntled Havers' resignation from the police force.  The two detectives will unravel a long and complicated mystery dating from a murder ten years earlier to find a surprising killer.""A Cry For Justice"" features a suicide that wasn't, a philanthropist with a bare knuckles approach to life, and a social club that isn't.  Havers, newly returned to Sergeant rank, promptly runs off on a undercover role, leaving Lynley to work the public side of the case while worrying about her safety.  The answers they seek are wound around a shocking conspiracy, an adopted child, and a shop girl with a secret.""If Wishes were Horses"" begins with the murder of a noted criminal profiler.  There are plenty of suspects, between the profiler's criminal cases and a collection of ex-wives and girlfriends.  Also implicated in the case is Helen, a former protege and now Lynley's very pregnant wife.  As additional corpses pile up, Havers and Lynley race to find the killer or killers.  In a stunning conclusion, tragedy will strike at the three people most dear to Lynley.""Inspector Lynley Mysteries Set 3"" is very highly recommeded to fans of the series.  It features four intriguing murder mysteries that will keep the viewer guessing, while Lynley and Havers work through an unusual burden of personal challenges to solve the cases.",1.0,0,37,6,56,0,0,2531,414,1,0.0056959336959337,0.8,58.92,73.85,0.002763414138063481,0.0027078011143076663,0.11082031489089472,0.8809916390077552,0.0027168308489790736,0.014618727775582773,0.00039494470774091627,4,4.333333333333333,0.041472,0.5,0.0,,long,

That honor, to me at least, was most deserved by Jon Shear's 'Urbania', and though it never won, it at least whipped up an audience and stirred commentary from various quarters, and any film that can do that is truly revolutionary.To say that 'Urbania' is gay-friendly would be naive. While this is predominantly a movie that deals with homophobia and the universal issue of acceptance and lack of, it becomes some sort of poster-boy for the neccessity of tolerance in our lives. It also goes on to show us that the greatest films are the ones least talked about. After I saw this movie, I was amazed at just how little attention it had received. Perhaps people aren't ready for such in-your-face storytelling. But I was, and have benefitted immensely in my personal life, from the lessons this film teaches us. 'Urbania' is one long lesson in enlightenment.The story is fairly simple. It starts off with our hero, as a sad wandering twenty-something searching for his special someone on the streets of New York, the city of the Urban Legend. Jon Shear goes on to show us that NYC really is the home of the tragic folk tale come true, and then proceeds to introduce us to the fact that the hero is gay. This comes not so much as a surprise as a casual unfolding of the story and fits in very nicely. However, the object of his obsession at the moment appears to be a straight man that most people would keep away from. Why the main character follows this man forms the rest of the tale, and I can't really give away more without revealing the ending and the mysteries between.Lets just say that this is a film with a shock at every turn. And not just for effect either. It has heart, and Charlie Futterman as our hero is anything but. I haven't seen such a powerful performance in ages. But the real star of the film is the director and his message. Jon Shear has the most interesting film-making style. I could compare him to Lars Von Trier, but Shear is more choppy and unrestrained in the use of the camera. He does have a lot of heart, though, and this shows, both in the intelligent script and in the amazing performances he extracts from his lead cast, including a spellbinding one from Matthew Keeslar.I have no idea where 'Urbania' will figure in the history of gay and lesbian cinema.

Having seen that movie, I didn't have high hope for this one but recently I passed the time by finally watching it. What a pleasant surprise, this movie was funny, a perfect blend of humor that was at times clever and at other times, slapstick. Ben Stiller playes Greg Focker, the Jewish suitor of the daughter of a tough, former CIA man named Jack Byrnes, hystreically played by Robert DiNiro. Armed with a polygraph and an inquisitorial manner, Jack, the overly protective father, is out to find out all he can about Greg. Meanwhile, Greg is visiting at the same time that there is a family wedding about to take place at the Byrnes residence.Naturally, the pressure that Jack puts on Greg causes Greg to tighten up. Anything that possibly can go wrong will and, ultimately does. Of course, the fact that there are wedding preparations taking place leads to a number of disasterous screwups to the wedding preparations as Greg, in his nervousness, manages to unintentionally wreak havoc on the upcoming affair. Complicating manners are incorrect assumptions by both Greg and Jack and these misunderstandings maginifies the screwups (for example, Jack erroneously believes that Greg is an active marijuana user).Naturally, there is a happy ending (in this type of comedy, doesn't that go without saying?). However, on the way, the major slapstick pratfalls make this an entertaining movie. In likeing the sequel less, maybe I instictively could see that really funny comdey was being milked, despite the fact that I hadn't seen the original.",0.0,0,22,4,49,1,0,1634,272,1,0.11390046296296298,0.5,58.72,75.88,0.002781979743710744,0.2237941308081179,0.0027919459056194315,0.6078614526528792,0.1627704908896727,0.01346389228886169,0.0,2,3.0,0.0208224,0.0,0.0,5.0,long,

While I had been intrigued by the trailer, I found the first two episodes extremely weak.  The show looked good, and had a decent amount of action, the uneven dramatics in episode 2, mixed with a very nasty, brutal kidnapping in the first episode left a bad taste in my mouth.  Still, I stuck with it, and by episode 4, I was hooked.The characters are in very well written. While it took me some time for me to warm up to the two leads, once I got to the end of this set I was understanding them better, and felt for them as they struggled to find a balance between what is truly right, and what society tells them is right.  The side characters are just as entertaining, with Masaoka and Yuki being stand outs for me (with Yuki being a huge shock, since she really only plays a very minor role until the last three episodes).The art is solid, although some of the design choices, especially when it comes to the characters' eyes, can take some getting use to.  The animation is beautiful, with a varied color palette used to create a vibrant and varied world.  While the urban settings are drab and run down, the cyber world is flush with bright colors and over the top character designs.  When the show moves to an all girls school it is awash with yellows and browns, creating a nostalgic world that seems almost out of place in the future.  The action scenes shine, with fluid animation, and some creative uses of CGI when the camera switches to a first person perspective.Psycho Pass is violent, and can almost feel cruel.  This is a show where the heroes don't always make it in time, or they don't act fast enough, and because of that, some characters pay the ultimate price.  While the second episode turns the emotional dramatics up so high it almost becomes laughable, the rest of the series gets a more solid grasp of the serious nature of what these characters have to deal with, and allows their relationships to develop at a more natural pace.I listened to the dub of this show, and I have to say, Funimation continues to turn out some very strong work.  While I still consider Shiki to be their best work, once the VA's get comfortable with their characters everyone turns in some stellar performances.Technically the discs are strong.  Both the Blu Ray and the DVD turn out great pictures, although Blu Ray is just a bit more vibrant.  The audio is strong as well, with no drop outs, or weird distortions.  There aren't a ton of extras, but that's pretty much par for the course for most current releases.For those who are looking for some dark, futuristic crime drama, I highly recommend Psycho Pass.

If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals.

I was thinking this was going to be a series of spy type movies, done very badly, with skimpy outfits on the women. What I wasn't expecting was all the toplessness. I don't think you get 5 min. into the first movie before a woman has taken off her top and is running around exposed. I'm not exactly complaining, but don't expect their parents to be very happy if you put this on for your teenage nephew or something.The movies range from completely inexplicable and mostly boring to mostly inexplicable and fairly entertaining. Sometimes there's a mix of those in between. I swear at times I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on plot wise, but I still had a mostly enjoyable time. If you picture bad movies run on cable TV on a weekend you get the idea, except with the aforementioned skin.  Actually, some of the gunfights, deaths, etc. were actually so badly done that they were incredibly amusing. The movies date from the 80s to the late 90s and sort of have a unifying theme. Expect to see things like VHS tapes and pagers.Considering you get 12 movies for so cheap, I don't think there's any way I could not recommend purchasing this set. Just don't expect blockbuster quality fair.  Even if you get a few laughs out of it, it's well worth it.

As the lights dim, the audience is ushered into the latest Allen production by the sound of retro music. Also typical of the writer and director's films, the movie is set in Manhattan.Much of the film is comprised of Allen staples. In fact, the only two things that seem to be out of place are the main characters, Biggs as Falk and Christina Ricci as Amanda. It is as if the casting agent blindly picked out two of the most popular teenybopper actors of today and threw them into the movie without regard for subject matter, dialogue or context.Amanda and Jerry live in the latter's apartment, which is inexplicably inhabited by old furnishings, better suited for a lower middle class grandmother. The audience is never told why the young couple's abode is decorated in such a manner, nor does it add anything to the script. Ikea, many a poor, post-graduate's favorite interior designer, would have provided a more believable and far less distracting setting, if the target audience is the latest crop of boy band chasers.This kind of uneasy dichotomy seems to run through the whole movie. The young stars seem to have been picked to draw in a younger audience. Yet, everything else is old. Allen is old, the furniture is old, and the music is old. Even Amanda and Falk's tastes are old by today's Gen-Y standards. In a scene set in the Village Vanguard, the couple discuss Humphrey Bogart, Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra. As Diana Krall ends a song, Amanda remarks that, &quot;She is so moving.&quot; Later, Jerry tries to woo Amanda in a music store by offering to purchase her a vinyl album of Cole Porter music.Allen's script is wholly mismatched for Biggs and Ricci. The work is better suited for more mature actors and audiences. It's what one would expect of an Allen love-child with the producers of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; except there aren't any compelling and contrived dramas.The film plods along with several different plotlines running and never quite meeting or making a solid point. It's almost like watching a disjointed reality television show about a random guy's life without having all the boring parts edited out. Even the normally seductive and conniving Ricci is reduced to being a neurotic and body obsessed female with a gratingly whiny voice.To Allen's credit, he does provide a few laughs with his writing. True to form, much of the movie is comprised of quick banter between the characters. Lines like &quot;There was something compelling about your apathy,&quot; and &quot;Don't be so middle class,&quot; are gems only Allen himself could dream up.However, these highlights may not compel audiences to choose this film. If you overhear someone saying that he wants to see &quot;anything else,&quot; don't be surprised if he actually means he want to see anything --other than the movie of the same name.",0.3333333333333333,2,34,7,101,0,0,2988,500,1,0.08559422348484845,0.4,61.77,106.67,0.05269866455781982,0.0014062540436266164,0.1986842599735993,0.5907109670537568,0.15649985437119737,0.011378848728246318,0.00011152001784320284,1,,0.0,0.25,0.6666666666666666,,long,

They go way over-budget by spending most of the dough on bloated production costs for a supposedly low-budget picture. It's a big enough crew to work on Braveheart. If they are going to have that kind of staff, they should increase the production costs so that the movie can compete with multi-million dollar blockbusters. Otherwise, get rid of half the staff, and spend more time and money working on the script.Watch the ""making of"" featurette on the Citizen Toxie bonus dvd. THAT'S low-budget filmaking. And Toxie is a movie that's watchable, too.2)The producers constantly bad-mouth their last Project Greenlight film, Stolen Summer. ""It's a REAL MOVIE this year,"" says Affleck.3)The directors show their dismay for allowing Chris Balis, the awful producer of the last project, to produce their movie. Cut to Balis wolfing down a bagel. Its obvious Chris Moore brought him on so he could have someone under his thumb. When Balis wisely suggests that there should be another editor on the movie other than the directors, to allow for a diffent point of view, Moore responds,""I see producing as supporting the directors' process, not subverting it!"". Balis is left impotent for the rest of the production. (Balis was right. The directors end up cutting the film and the movie is awful.).4)Moore blames everyone else for the faults of the movie, yet its his hands-off approach (read: he's never there), allowing the directors to do whatever they want, that in large part is what's responsible for the movie's failure. When he asks the writer on the set how she could allow the directors to run roughshod over her script, after giving her no power at all to prevent it, she rightly responds,""F-You, Dude!""5)The only time EXECUTIVE PRODUCER Ben Affleck arrives on the set, its with superstar girlfriend J-Lo. Not too disruptive to a production, is it? Reminds me of when Elizabeth Taylor would show up to Richard Burton's set with her whole entourage.6)We see Good ol' Matt Damon at the beginning of the series, when they choose the winners, and then at the end, when filming is finished. He doesn't even show up at the premeire, but cuts a ten second closing comment for the series from another location. However, he's wearing a Project Greenlight hat, so he must have been deeply involved. HAW!!

Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom.Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors.Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward.The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids.Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect.Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion.",0.9130434782608695,2,7,1,92,1,0,3764,679,1,-0.03258928571428571,0.6000000000000001,66.88,36.62,0.0011848354529138663,0.001188782234589924,0.0011842620079991685,0.6403773622150347,0.3560647580894623,0.0018597236981934113,0.00024250822795773426,1,,0.0,0.875,1.826086956521739,,long,

Let me tell you how, the American version takes a deeper look into the relationships between the chatacters and lets you decide for yourself why you should care about them.  And let me tell you something at times you do wonder why you care, but that's because each charater is made so wonderfully human.  You get the feeling that you've at one time or another met at least one of these people, or at times have done things similar to them.  What drew me in and hooked me wasn't the sex, but the center realtionsip of Michael and Brian. I found myself understanding why Michael puts up with some of the things he does concerning his best friend, and you're given glimpses into why Brian acts the way he does.  Some of the secondary story lines didn't work out that well but you forgive it because what does work, works fantastically, and wonderously well.  If you come to this looking for a comemtary on all gay life you won't get it.  This is about a specific gruop of gay friends and how they live their lives and how they deal with the situations that come up in everyday life.  It's about love, respect, friendship and the power these things have.  It's about how someone can say one thing and mean another, its about how who we think we are is sometimes not who we really are.  Its about how your life keeps moving while you're still making plans.  Its about the subtle and not so subtle adjustments we make in order to live our lives.  Its about compramise and standing firm, its about holding on and letting go.

Ever.,"""A Simple Plan"" isn't your ordinary thriller where you know exactly who's the bad guy and who's the good guy.  This isn't the type of thriller where you know right way who's pulling the strings.  ""A Simple Plan"" is a one-of-a-kind thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie.  You are just about to find out that sometimes good people do evil things.This movie is about three men who stumple upon a crashed airplane.  Inside is a dead pilot....and a bag full of cash.  They can keep the money.  It's not stealing......is it?  Well, they're about to find out how something that seems so simple can end up costing whole lot more than any of them can even imagine.The acting is great in this movie.  Paxton and Thornton do a really good job in their roles.  Bridget Fonda also does a great job, being the wife who eggs her husband on and devises all of the plans and schemes for him on how to keep the money.  Sam Raimi does an outstanding job as director.  The cinematography is also breathtaking.What I really like about this movie is the story.  It's a very thought-provoking and disturbing thriller that has numerous twists and turns along the way.  And the ending.....wow.  You're not going to believe how this movie will end.The DVD is great when it comes to sound and picture quality.  Especially picture quality.  One of those DVDs where you see the picture clear as crystal.  It lacks in special features, as always the case with Paramount.  So don't have your heart set on that aspect of the DVD.""A Simple Plan"" is a brilliant thriller with a very clever and well-structured plot.  If you like thrillers with edge and disturbing twists, this is the movie for you.

Could it be that we listen to a lot of disturbing music?  Maybe it's because we're too in love with firearms.  Well, as the film goes on, we find out that all of the other countries love violent movies, disturbing music, and guns just as much as we do (even more so, in some cases).  Interesting questions are brought up that offer new points that rarely have been discussed before (like the impact of news programs).  We get more insight into the &quot;Columbine Massacre,&quot; and the impact guns can have on a child.  What we get is an interesting ride that is filled with humor and heart.Again, I'm no &quot;Michael Moore&quot; cheerleader; as I do not agree with him on everything he's said in the past.  However, I think he does a great job in his documentaries.  I even found &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; to be better than his first film, &quot;Roger &amp; Me.&quot;  You're not supposed to take everything that is said here to heart.  That's not what Moore wants at all.  The film's purpose is to bring up some different point of views and give us some very different questions that we have never encountered before.  In the end, it is YOU who decides what is going on and if you believe some of the things that are presented in this movie.The DVD is EXCELLENT when it comes to special features.  This 2-disk Special Edition includes extras like an exclusive interview with Michael Moore, commentary, Marilyn Manson's &quot;Fight Song&quot; music video, trailer, photo gallery, &quot;The Charlie Rose Show,&quot; and so much more.  The film looks and sounds great, as the budget and quality improved greatly with this one.&quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; isn't here to offer you solutions.  Nor is it here to make you think the way Michael Moore thinks and feels.  In the end, it is only a movie, and nothing more.  It's up to you to decide if it's going to have an impact on your life in some way or not.  Even if you don't like Moore or agree with the man on every single thing, it is still very much possible to enjoy this film.

Secondarily, there is a romantic side of the plot between the main character, the very lovely leading lady, and her fiance.  The film also highlights the strength and interplay of Chinese family relationships--for those reacting to the western presence in different ways--in a wonderful way (remeniscent of the Fong Sai Yuk films with Jet Li).  In the end, the moral mainstay of traditional Chinese culture wins the day with a very satisfying resolution of circumstances.The action choreography is quite well done (bravo! Yuen Woo-Ping!), making good use of multiple angles and very good use of slow motion to showcase the grace, power and superiority of Tai Chi.  While there is limited use of wire, it is fairly well integrated with the rest of the fight sequence(s) and does not in any way detract from the general tone of the film, or eclipse the excellent emphasis on the Tai Chi methods.If at all possible, get the original Hong Kong import version of this film (I bought mine for $7.99 from EDay Movie: [...]  The picture and sound quality are top-knotch, even though the English subtitles display the occasional spelling or grammatical anamoly (which I have come to expect--and even to enjoy(!)--over the years).All tolled, a stellar offering that easily merits the top-shelf and quite possibly the top-ten in anyone's kung-fu movie collection!

The structure is a fairly traditional one:  comic playing off a straight man, topically updated with psychotherapy, family tensions, and modern celebrityhood.  The huge success in this case comes from the manic pace and the brilliant teamwork of Murray/Dreyfuss.  Bill Murray is the problem patient fobbed off on the egotistical doctor, Richard Dreyfuss, who is ultimately seen to be the more pathetic and needful of the two.  As wonderful as Murray is, the film rises to the top because of the contribution of Richard Dreyfuss.  Like all great comedy, there is a wonderful lode of humor to be mined out of Dreyfuss' pain.

A lot of the scary scenes were very much like the TCM, and had the same chainsaw scenes. One scene had a girl being examined (am sure that some film footage hit the floor) for her ability to bear kids... but it was never fully explained if she was to be used to continue the vampire bloodline.Then she is redressed in a red dress (why the fasination with red dresses) and slippers that she wears the remainder of the film. the filming was top notch and most of the filming took place in an abandoned factory,and nightclub.

The Rastafarian jellyfish bordered on ethnic insensitivity.

I'd never watched the old Animated series, nor read the comics or played with one of the toys.When this film's production was announced, I shrugged, saying to myself 'Its a toy movie, how good can they possibly make a toy movie?' and decided I was not going to watch this movie in theaters.As the posters came out, followed by the trailers, I ignored them completely, convinced that this movie would be completely worthless, and I was going to take no part in it.A week or so after it opened, one of my friends called me up stating that he was rounding up a few of our mutual friends to go see Transformers. It was the middle of the summer, I'd been working 30 something hour weeks and I hadn't had much time to see anyone, so I agreed, figuring that at least I'd get to hang out with some people.We headed over the the movie theater, I reluctantly paid for the movie ticket, and sat outside the theater waiting to be admitted.Of the six of us, all but two thought exactly as I did, that this movie was probably going to be a waste.We got our seats, sat and talked, watched the trailers, and the movie began.It opened with the All Spark floating through space, and Peter Cullen's superb voice narrating.By the time the attack in Qatar sequence had finished, I turned to my best friend who was sitting next to me and said ""You know, I seriously underestimated this movie."" He nodded, and we both turned back to the screen.In short, this movie blew my socks off.The Autobots and Decepticons look superb, and the fight sequences, while occasionally hard to follow due to the mass of the robots themselves, are just amazing. The music hits you just as much as the look of the Transformers do, completing the effect of pure movie magic.The storyline, the most important piece of any film in my opinion, is action packed and driven, taking you from Qatar to the Pentagon to the Hoover Dam, and leaving you with an ending that just screams for a sequel.This is one movie that has not been over hyped, it is well worth the time and the money, and the only wish I would have in regard to this film is that I had gone to seen it earlier in theaters, and multiple times.",0.0,2,31,4,63,1,0,2255,414,1,0.14884792626728113,0.1,73.51,8.2,0.0019249187974082805,0.11797287962776443,0.07799321746966904,0.05367092406986279,0.7484380600352954,0.013747228381374724,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,long,

This movie captures Los Angeles better than most and in that setting it creates a credible story with a fine cast that, apart from the gore of dismembering a body attached to two opposing cars and a lot of bullets and killings, makes a case for the idea of a group of rogue cops bringing Mickey Cohen down.In 949 Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city as well as an eye on the entire West Coast: his dream is to rid the crime world of the Chicago mobs' move to take over big crime in LA. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara, with the help of his pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) chooses 4 cops (Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Giovanni Ribisi) and asks another cop and vet, pretty boy Jerry Wooters, to join him but Wooters is not interested: he incidentally is dating Cohen's current girlfriend (Emma Stone). But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops. The manner in which the dance between Cohen's henchmen and the gangster squad plays out is full of surprises and twist and turns and makes for solid entertainment. Based on a book by the same name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion.

Sure the original Planet of the Apes is a sci-fi classic for the ages, with its brilliant acting, directing, social commentary, and the greatest movie ending ever. Then on came the sequels, all four of them, each one cheesier and goofier than the one before it. This of course was thanks to smaller and smaller budgets (the quality of the movies would have been far increased if a little more money was spent), and the increasingly sloppy directing. (Schaffner why did you have to direct ONE film?) Plus the plots of the next four films contradict the plot of the first one more and more with each movie. While the sequels were good at times (sometimes great) they were never consistently good.But thats not the reason this box is a 3 star affair. This gets that rating for its lack of any interesting extras. All we have is some cheesy trailers, and an interesting documentary, but one that is now available on a separate DVD.So if you want a piece of the Planet of the Apes legacy I would buy the original movie on its own and the documentary and save yourself some money.

I'm glad Amazon had it in this ODD COUPLE CENTENNIAL COLLECTION 2-DVD SET which I purchased immediately.The movie is hilarious! It's about two middle-aged men who are friends and find themselves single again. Oscar Madison (Matthau) is divorced, living alone, and a total slob when his friend Felix Ungar (Lemmon), gets thrown out of his house when his wife has had enough of Felix's nit-picking and obsessive cleanliness. They couldn't be more different than night and day, but Felix ends up moving in with Oscar and together they find out how far they can push their friendship.Both Lemmon and Matthau are a great combination having great on screen chemistry together. Herbert Edelman as ""Murray,"" John Fiedler as ""Vinnie,"" David Sheiner as ""Roy,"" and Larry Haines as ""Speed"" are wonderful as the poker boys; and even though they only had a small part Monica Evans as ""Cecily"" and Carole Shelley as ""Gwendolyn""--the Pidgeon Sisters--also make this movie memorable. The soundtrack is outstanding and I like seeing the outside shots of NYC.The movie looks great on DVD and I love the theme music. The second DVD has good behind the scenes extras with interviews in the present with cast members David Sheiner and Carole Shelley, Director Gene Saks, Studio Head Robert Evans, talk show host Larry King and Chris Lemmon and Charlie Matthau (they look just like their dads) who talk about their fathers. There are also pictures from behind the scenes etc., and the set comes with small fold out 4-page booklet with notes.If you like 60s stuff and classic comedy, I highly recommend THE ODD COUPLE-CENTENNIAL COLLECTION.",1.0,0,36,6,59,0,1,1730,292,1,0.19860119047619046,0.425,67.18,90.77,0.42467384865977337,0.25653038160038955,0.0021015715476194793,0.3145833268936982,0.00211087129851945,0.020809248554913295,0.0005777007510109763,2,5.0,0.0858816,0.5,0.0,,long,

I think I heard it was a buy or at least rent on DVDUESDAY.  Well, I would have to disagree.  The movie is about these people in a town, set back in the days when cowboys and Indians were around, who find aliens have come to get something from them.  That is the story.  Then, you have a guy who was with a woman, though you never see them together, who wakes up and does not remember anything.  But, he has this weird thing around his wrist.  Turns out aliens may have taken him and the lady and some how he got away.  He is also wanted for killing the lady.  Though he may not have done that.  Get it?  That is the story.Now for the bad part, or ""the movie"" itself.  Wow, so many things were wrong with this in my opinion.  Let me take it one step at a time.First the actors.  There were a bunch of great actors in the movie.  Some you would see the entire time, others here and there.  But, for some reason, it felt like I was watching a trailer the entire time.  Almost like a movie they made to show at the Oscars.  It was very odd.Next, the effects and backgrounds.  AWFUL,  everything that you see in the movie, you can tell that it is fake and not very well done.  The mountains may have been actually mountains, but they were the worst mountains that I've ever seen.  The times when you saw the aliens or the technology they used also seemed cheaply done.  It was like I was watching a damn commercial or something from 10 years ago.  Watch the movie and reply with what you think.Next would be the story.  Ok, so aliens that are smart enough to fly around the never ending space and then find something on our planet they need and or want.  Are you telling me they would not just come, take what it was and leave without us even knowing?  For some reason they are pissed off and decide to kill the people.  But that is just a story choice I suppose.  For some reason, I could never get into this movie.  I love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.  Like it was being shoved down my throat.  After 15 minutes, I had already forgotten what had happened before.  It was like I was watching something trying so hard to be funny, action packed, thrilling and mysterious, that never really got there.  Oh, and it you have eyes, you may want to skip this movie.  Why you ask?  For at least 2/5 of the movie.  My family and I could not see a damn thing.  The lighting if some of the worst I've ever seen, or haven't seen for that matter.  We were all like ""what the hell is going on?""  At one part one of the characters asks if the man can see his target.  I busted out laughing.  The end is boring and you will probably be upset you wasted your time watching.  For so many good actors and a good director, this movie sucked.  If this is what aliens bring, then let us send E.T back home!!!!As I said, we rented this from FIOS.  So, I can not review the special features or the packaging.",0.5384615384615384,6,49,11,95,4,4,3033,584,1,0.0062319624819624836,-0.25,94.15,85.69,0.0013281062226505,0.052066453232954876,0.001326592380237479,0.001311259462955549,0.9439675887012016,0.01615562149686779,0.0001774757872318848,1,,0.0,0.5,3.230769230769231,2.6666666666666665,long,

Immersed in the spy world without posting blinking signs to the genre - minimum gadgetry - the movie is a brisk, excellent global tour of international politics.In Matt Damon, the series, mined from Robert Ludlum's novels, has a man of everyday, blockheaded features capable of physical extremes; this is not Tom Cruise tossing back his hair, suspended in vanity from a rock. There is moment when Jason Bourne, in mourning, looks pinched and ugly, an excellent capture of sadness. Bourne barely breathes in this movie, and he doesn't speak much more. Waste in not in his vocab, nor the film's.Still haunted by memories of the mission that helped trigger his amnesia in &quot;Identity,&quot; the first film, Bourne has found a ocean hideout in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Across the world, in Berlin, Bourne is being framed for two murders in a CIA sting gone bad. Soon after, a Russian assassin (Karl Urban, excellent if virtually silent) is after Bourne and Marie, who is killed after a car accident on a bridge. Bourne is then onto Naples, Italy, where he must reenter the CIA grid as deputy directors Pamela Lundy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) wait to descend. Both want Bourne. Lundy prefers him alive; Abbott pushes for death. Bourne seeks his framers and the source of his dreams. It leads to Room 645 in a Berlin hotel.As a young colleague (Julia Stiles, in garish highlights) puts it, Bourne doesn't make mistakes, he makes moves, drawing the crosshairs closer, the better to learn his captors motives. He lands in three major jams, the last pitting him against that Russian assassin, every bit Bourne's equal, in a Moscow tunnel. Staged by director Paul Greengrass, these public chases are feats of speed and editing, daring enough to admire Bourne's considerable spy skills while still this side of believable - Damon sustains a limp after landing hard on a barge. As in the first movie, boxy European four-doors are the vehicles of choice as Bourne evades his captors - slow, yet seeming to endure almost endless structual damage, they are mechanical companions to Bourne. Functional, indestructible.Joan Allen, glaring soft like steel wool, is perfectly cast as CIA ice queen Lundy - by-the-book and clever, but not Jason Bourne clever. But Cox, as Abbott, is hamstrung by the red arrow pointing at his character. Tony Gilroy returns for the screenplay, and it is again literate, hushed and direct, proving that stories absent of joy - gray skies abound, and Moscow simply doesn't play host to happiness - still entertain through the force of their intelligent gambits. Whereas the Jack Ryan series got caught up with the pedestrian manliness of Harrison Ford, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is content to keep working the angles, the reward being a night of sleep, or a simple, overdue apology. It's spy food for those with perspective.",0.25,3,56,10,119,0,0,3057,501,1,0.15921474358974355,0.21428571428571427,66.57,78.25,0.002307185244799087,0.0023210277615183066,0.22490151281577897,0.6089117560811536,0.16155851809675,0.01831861301929997,8.175277959450622e-05,2,4.0,0.0,0.2,0.75,3.3333333333333335,long,

There are the bad/terrible, you get to choose, films directed by Joel Shumacher.  In these movies the bad guys are covered in neon colors and are busy ice skating around Batman while they are trying to fight him.  Everything is colorfull and Batman even whips out a Bat-credit card.  UGHHHH!  Then there are the good/great Batman films, once again you get to choose.  These films are dark and very intense.  Batman is played by a person who understands what Bruce Wayne's character is about, meaning how tormented he is by his parent's death and how he wants to bring justice to Gotham City.  Oh yeah, these films are directed by Tim Burton who seems like the person that Batman movies were meant to directed by.  These movies are the example that ""Batman Begins"" followed.  In this movie Batman/Bruce Wayne returns to his dark roots.This film basically explores Bruce Wayne's past.  It goes into great detail of what happened to him after to his parent's murder.  It explains how he became a fearful, revenge-minded person that sought training to prevent criminals from flourishing in Gotham City.  It goes into how he came to decide on becoming Batman.  How he got his utility belt, his costume and the Batmobile.  There's also a story of him saving Gotham City from nerve gas that makes you go permantly crazy, but thats not were the main story lies.  Its kind of a side show.First of all, any fan of Batman should thank Christopher Nolan if you aver meet him.  As mentioned earlier, he has made Batman a dark super hero once again.  One of the great things that he created an image of was the fear that bad guys had of Batman.  In this film, Batman would pop out a dark spot and snatch a bad guy, just like in the comic books.  The bad guys were really scared of the Dark Knight, which is how it should be.  Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  He played the most intense and darkest Batman to date.  His Batman voice was a little too scruffy, but nothing else was bothersome.  The rest of the supporting cast, which included Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, and Katie Holmes, did a good job also.  Not too much to complain about with the flick.I would have to say that this film is definitely a challenger for the best of the series.  This movie is so far the movie to see this summer.

There are some solid performances (the leads) and some cheesy ones (Alexis Arquette & Jill St John).  There is a truly amazing soundtrack.  There is that sense of deja-vu all over again as you recall where you were in your life during the various episodes of the film.Because the scope is so big, and the time frame so long, there are large gaps in the story and the development of the characters. This means I lost my investment in them.  Watching the deleted scenes on the disc helped fill in a bit, and the behind the scenes film also helped.  But, without having seen those, the closing left me feeling preached at.I was a bit disappointed after reading so many positive reviews.  I am not saying 'don't watch it;' just 'don't have too high of expectations.'  At the same time, I hope to see other films from this director.

Think about it:  Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha -- detached from everything except pure love.  Meanwhile, Robin Wright Penn is portrayed as an idiot because she invests herself in silly causes such as opposing the Vietnam War.  We are manipulated into sympathizing with the figure who remains utterly detached from life instead of the figure who cares about the world around her.Meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching:  a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.This is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.  At the end of the movie, ""Nashville,"" Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel-good nihilism by having everyone leave the theater singing ""You may say that I ain't free, it don't worry me."" with gospel abandon.  The raves that the movie Forest Gump got proves Altman's point.No one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.  But, at its core, it is spiritually bankrupt.  While it is not as powerful a film as ""Triumph of the Will"" and the ""philosophy"" it attempts to manipulate the audience into buying isn't as remotely evil as that of Leni R's patrons, it is nonetheless of that ilk -- a successful attempt to bypass the audience's frontal lobe.",0.3150684931506849,50,52,6,42,0,0,1789,302,1,0.15173992673992676,0.15,54.56,-53.06,0.04285255586761328,0.1870581774539509,0.003171463819638475,0.48447586906768614,0.2824419337911112,0.029066517607602014,0.00017601591796127648,1,,0.0,0.3108108108108108,15.753424657534246,5.0,long,

A great adaptation of the superb series by Suzanne Collins. Obviously some things have to be left out, as all novels to film go, but they did a wonderful job regardless. I do however understand, that if you have not read/or you did not enjoy the books, that you probably will not enjoy the film as much as an avid fan like myself.Even critics (not that I take their opinion into consideration) who hate all the good movies, gave it a good review. It was refreshing to see an excellent and extremely unique movie for a change, with all the static of junk movies out there. I only have one negative thing to say, the cinematography was extremely jumpy(either due to style, an attempt to tame the violence, or both) The actors for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were perfect.Prepare for; violence in a fight to survive, the effects of war on children and their families, valor and heart, a bit of romance, maybe a few tears, and struggles from the oppression of a totalitarian Government. I can't wait to see the other movies in the trilogy. This is a must see! You don't have to own it as I will, but I would watch it at least once to form your own opinion.

Yet it falls well short of its potential.The best thing about The Cooler is Maria Bello. She is among a handful of the most beautiful women on the screen these days. As Natalie she exudes an emotional depth and an aching honesty that almost makes this movie something great.Almost.Despite similarly wonderful performances from Baldwin and Macy, this dark comedy drowns in its &quot;dark&quot; (dank to be more precise). The Cooler can't figure out if it wants to be a gangster flick, a romantic comedy, a dark comedy, or an elegy for the old ways of Vegas. That the movie almost pulls this off is a credit to the actors involved.The Cooler misses its mark though. I found it enjoyable, but I have the feeling that most of my friends would either have their patience tested or balk at the heavy violence and sexual content. People watching a slightly more humorous version of Leaving Las Vegas still have to deal with the existential goo of Leaving Las Vegas--no matter the outcome or humor along the way.That said, if you feel you're up to the challenge, The Cooler, for all its scattershot befuddlement, does sing a strain of the greatest song of all: the song of Love and its power to save and transform--a song well worth listening to--in any form.&quot;Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave.

And her books reflected her knowledge of how that society lived. Unfortunately, she passed away before completing this novel, but this mini-series has been adapted per the notes she left behind. Edith Wharton was not Jane Austen. Her novels present more true to life situations and are peopled with individuals who are more realistic.In ""The Bucaneers,"" four young ladies whose families are attempting to break into high society are not achieving the success their families had hoped for: courtship and marriages with the best of society. In desperation, Mrs. St. George (mother to 2 of the girls - Virginia and Nan) send her daughters to England in hopes of securing their position in society and possibily making good marriages there. One of the 4 girls, Conchita Closson, does manage to marry an British aristocrat. The final girl, Lizzy Elmsworth, eventually ends up in England.The mini-series revolves around the girls experience with courtship and ultimate marriages, and the fact of what must be dealt with when one marries for social position instead of love. And how they eventually because part of that upper society their families had always wanted for them - and at what sacrifice.There was a time when women had few choices in life, and to go against those choices was to be ostracized and abandoned by friends and family. It wasn't merely a decision whether to be happy - it was decision of survival. And this story shows that very well. It is said that Ms. Wharton used Consuelo Vanderbilt as her inspiration for Conchita Closson, and Lady Randolph Churchill as her inspiration for Lizzy Elmsworth. Who knows?This story is not all rainbows and butterflies. But it allows the viewer to think on where women have been, and where they have come, and if they would have made the same decisions had they been in the same situation.The acting is a little bit to be desired, but overall, the scenery, the costumes, and the storyline are wonderful.

The band is phemonenal.  Ditto the arrangements.  I actually had the DVD on my table for over a week...from the moment I put it on, I was in rapture!  Greg indeed has not been in this fine form in years.  He sounded tired and raspy during the ELP tours of the 90's...not on this performance.  These renditions of classic ELP and King Crimson material  are stunning.  The audio is superb, as is the camerawork.  Greg's voice is better than I've heard it since the eighties.And no, I'm not just one more rabid ELP fan gazing through rose-colored glasses...I don't award a five-star rating to much of anything!  I can't wait to burn the audio of this show to a CD-R.  Greg also displays a humble outlook as he shares between songs.  Very refreshing on a concert DVD.  The arrangement of Take a Pebble includes an astonishing guitar solo from one of his band members.  If there's an ""uninteresting"" track on this disc, it would have to be Pictures at an Exhibition, simply because the arrangement is virtually identical to the studio version ELP did back in the early 90's.  It's still a strong performance, too; I had merely gotten ""spoiled"" by the fresh twists in the other classic material.Having also seen footage of Keith Emerson's band from 2006, I'd say he and Greg Lake are performing better with the ""fresh blood"" of new musicians inspiring them.

I wouldn't say he is a great filmmaker, but he does know how to make an enjoyable movie that has enough gore and or sleaze to make up for any shortcomings he has as a filmmaker.Black Demons though in my opinion was pretty much a waste. While it did have the so bad its good moments, as a whole it was just bad. I knew what kind of movie I was getting, but based on what I have seen from Umberto Lenzi I was expecting a mindless gorefest, but sadly that's not what I got well besides the mindless part.The screenplay written by Olga Pehar was simply horrible; the horror genre may not always be known for the scripts, but this was just bad. The dialogue is cringe worthy. The characters were terrible; while the concept was fairly decent I suppose nothing in the screenplay works at all. The dialogue is just idiotic everything is well idiotic.Umberto Lenzi is unable to build up much tension or atmosphere. The scenes are poorly paced and lack any tension through out. Black Demons runs at about 90-min, but quite honestly it feel a hell of a lot longer than that. Umberto Lenzi can craft a sleazy fun time, but here he just falls flat. The biggest problem is the lack of action. The longer the movie goes without any the more boring it gets.The acting was weak, which is to be expected but I have seen worse, but Philip Murray has to rate as one of the very worst actors I have ever seen. From the way he delivers his lines, to his movements and facial expressions he was just bad. But with that said he does help the movie in ways and helps it have the so bad its good moments. Without Phillip Murray's terrible acting Black Demons would have been a complete waste of time.The scariest thing about Black Demons is the rest of the actors come across as fairly decent when compared to Phillip Murray. I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy acting, but this one was pretty damn bad as far as acting goes.Black Demons released in 1991 in many ways is the last of the 80s horror film. The movie really does look like something out of the 80s, but also what people have to remember is even though the decade ends it normally takes a year or 2 before films begin to change.Despite the title Black Demons this is a zombie flick and like Lenzi's Nightmare City he likes to mix things up. In many ways this is sort of a slasher flick meets a zombie flick. There is a scene with one zombie stalking one of the characters and when there is a knock at the door the zombie backs off. Also the zombies prefer to use weapons as well.Black Demons also goes under the title of Demons 3, which makes people think this was a sequel to Lamberto Bava's Demons flicks. Black Demons is not a sequel. So do not go in expecting anything like those flicks. Black Demons was billed as Demons 3 for marketing reasons.Bottom line is Black Demons is a very poor movie; it's too slow paced at times and when there is action it really doesn't help much. The couple of gore scenes are fairly decent, but cannot save the movie. As much as I love Italian horror by this time it was clear the horror industry in Italy was pretty much dead except for a couple of filmmakers who were able to make some good movies.In closing I cannot honestly think of anything really good to say about Black Demons. It's too slow paced, not enough action the little gore we get is decent, but nothing to get excited about.",0.0,1,12,2,67,0,0,3458,648,1,-0.03530753968253969,-0.4,78.59,120.21,0.0009897888797498766,0.0009925652075466814,0.0009873367444403131,0.0010033116894011846,0.9960269974788619,0.003470213996529786,0.0,2,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

Lucio Fulci like I always say was a filmmaker who sparked debates among horror fans. Some love him and others see him as a no talent splatter director, but before Fulci became a splatter director he did some top notch Giallo work that sadly went over-looked.If you're looking for what became the typical Fulci movie loaded with a high body count and a whole lot of gore well you best look elsewhere. Most of the violence happens off camera and what we see gore wise is very, very little. The Psychic was made back before Fulci started his splatter era, which was only 2-years away. Many people feel Fulci was a lousy filmmaker, but I have to disagree. Even in his splatter era he was a good filmmaker. He knew how to build tension, but it was often over-looked due to poor dubbing, an incoherent plot, idiotic characters and a whole lot of the red stuff.With The Psychic, Fulci attempts to tell a story using filmmaking skills rather than blood. And he sort of did that in some areas, but in others The Psychic just didn't work. The Psychic is a very slow burn type movie that relies on story and characters and there is a little bit of a problem.The screenplay was written by Lucio Fulci, Roberto Gianviti and Dardano Sacchetti, but according to Sacchetti, Lucio didn't write a single word to the movie. He would show up at meetings and say what he liked or disliked, but never actually wrote. I don't see what Sacchetti would gain from lying, but since Fulci is credited I will acknowledge him as a writer regardless of what's true. From a writing stand-point The Psychic had all the right ideas. And all the ideas were mostly executed well. But the problem was the characters.The Psychic is one of those movies where you really can't tell who's who. None of the characters have much depth and honestly after the movie is over you'll be hard pressed to remember any of the names of the characters. The Psychic relies on story and characters, and while the story is pretty much there it's the characters that aren't. They're all as thin as the paper they were written on. If this was a Fulci splatter flick it really wouldn't matter. But when a movie relies on story and characters without one it just won't totally work.There is a nice mystery surrounding the story and it really does work well for the most part; but without the characters it does hurt a little bit. I'm not really familiar with Roberto Gianviti besides Murder Rock, which he wrote and Fulci directed. Dardano Sacchetti is one of the biggest names in Italian cinema if not the biggest horror writer. You name the cult classic he did it and several of those were with Lucio Fulci.The screenplay is quite interesting and mostly moves forward. It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle with the psychic visions. The lead character Virginia Ducci played by Jennifer O'Neil has to piece them all together and it does make for an interesting premise, but again I go back to the weak characters. In general horror movies often don't have the best developed characters and one can argue Fulci and Sacchetti never really wrote a lot of movies that featured well developed characters. Overall like I said the screenplay works well but the characters are what hurt it.Lucio Fulci fairs much better as a director, but there is only so much he can do. The first hour of The Psychic can be quite slow, but Fulci manages to keep the pace moving at a pretty good, but slow pace. You might find yourself slightly bored at times, but Fulci manages to keep the plot going and keep the viewer interested for the most part. The final 30-minutes are quite good and as good as you'll find in any Giallo. The chase scene towards the end is probably the finest Fulci ever put together.The visual look also really helps. Lucio Fulci along with DP Sergio Salvati create a great visual look. These two have worked together many times and most of Fulci's best movies were with Salvati. The scenes are well lit and give an eerie feel and Fulci loves the eyes and you get plenty of close up of the eyes. When used in the right situation that can really add to the tension, but when used at the wrong time it fails. Here, Fulci uses it at the right times and it adds to the tension.The Psychic does feature a lot of nice plot twists that really add to the movie and proves Fulci was more than just a gore director and for the most part The Psychic is coherent. I would say The Psychic is one of Fulci's more solid movies, but just lacks with the characters. The plot mostly always moves forward and it worked quite well, but again I just found the characters lacking. Even with those flaws I would say this is one of Fulci's better movies. It's not as good as Don't Torture a Duckling, but better than a lot of Fulci's work in the 80s.The Psychic is one of the sort of forgotten Lucio Fulci movies and it really deserves a wider audience. The movie has its fair share of flaws, but it's also a solid Giallo that mostly moves forward with the plot. Fans of Fulci will wanna seek this one out and even those who dislike Fulci might wanna give this one a try. Besides the visual look this isn't the Fulci most people know. There is hardly any blood and it's mostly coherent. Not a perfect film, but a solid movie in Lucio Fulci's career.",0.6666666666666666,2,41,7,119,0,0,5378,980,1,0.17828254696373957,0.0,70.33,64.37,0.0007216366420947735,0.0007241175187125885,0.0007191649838546658,0.1691088832313876,0.8287261976239504,0.0076236519152101155,0.0001239387742455227,2,,0.0063072,0.5714285714285714,1.3333333333333333,,long,

This movie stands the test of time. Not only does it benefit from the mastery of pantomime performed by Chaplin, it includes sound effects and other technological advances that came with the sound revolution.Of all the silent movies I have seen, this music score is one of the best, probably because Chaplin took the time to write it himself. It suits the scenes well and demonstrates Chaplin's ability to be a jack-of-all-trades when it came to the movie industry.The jokes are still funny, the characters are still likeable, and the end is still satisfying.

Dr. Jekyll is a scientist who believes each man has two sides, the good and the bad. He concocts a potion that brings out his brutish side, who he calls Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde then becomes uncontrollable, and a menace to Jekyll.This is definitely a literary adaptation, so the action is slower than one might expect. Rouben Mamoulian created more of a legitimate production rather than a sensationalized Hollywood flick. As a result, the craftsmanship of the movie is superior. The transformation from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde is impressive, especially for 1932 before the days of computer animation. The photography is quite haunting too. The scenes of Dr. Jekyll escaping to his laboratory are very memorable, as is the grand finale where Mr. Hyde runs down the streets away from the angry mob as their shadows loom on the walls behind them.However, not everything is exactly the same as the book, which is rather short.There are also pre-code elements that fans of the genre will enjoy. Ivy is a prostitute after all, and references of her immorality and the things Hyde does to her are quite shocking.

It cares enough to lend some plausibility to the girls&#8217; predicament. A group of young women are sent out on a milder &#8220;Outward Bound&#8221; sort of excursion away from their accustomed urban comforts. All of them have been compulsive over-users of cell phone and Internet technology, sometimes with serious consequences. So there&#8217;s a reason for their being set down in the woods without a working cell phone among them.Then the conversation here is much more realistic than the usual film-version of conversation among teens before they start getting picked off by backwoods psychopaths. While the two-hour limitations of the film doesn&#8217;t allow us to get to know all nine girls very well, we do get a glimpse of some of their distinctive personalities. What&#8217;s most refreshing is that these girls&#8217; conversation isn&#8217;t limited to foul-mouthed belligerence towards each other. If fact, there&#8217;s no such road rage high volume verbal abuse at all, even when one or the other of them displays some very irritating quirks. The others tend to indulge their comrades&#8217; idiosyncrasies, and to even be polite about them. A real film rarity!This group leader-counselor is also a more believable, interesting person than we usually encounter in any scary movie. She has a low-key, quiet manner that, on top of her delicate adult beauty, draws the viewer into her circle.But overall, there isn&#8217;t a lot of dialogue in this movie. The long, waiting silences add to the tension.However, it&#8217;s the film&#8217;s ending that most distinguishes it. Perhaps you can&#8217;t quite term the ending a twist, but it carries the full-blown surprise of forgotten elements &#8211; suddenly recalled. You won&#8217;t feel the shock of this surprise until the very last line of the film though.

After a four year stint in reform school due to the burglary of a pistol, he serves time in the military.  He heads back home after his discharge and goes with his best friends Clyde and Dave to the local carnival.  It is there he meets up with sharpshooter and performer Annie Laurie Starr played by Cummins.  The unemployed Dall acquires a position in the carnival.They fall for each other and soon get fired by the jealous carnival owner and commence a crime wave inspired by the aberrant Cummins.  She's a high rolling English girl who loves money and excitement and influences the malleable and lovesick Dall into a life of crime.  Dall's lack of a killer instinct makes him a reluctant robber however his love for the lethal Cummins sucks him in deeper and deeper.On the lam after a number of petty ante stickups they agreed to pull one last job and get out.  The plan a robbery of the payroll of a large meat packing plant where they've both secured jobs. Unfortunately trhe trigger happy Cummins kills two employees in the course of their escape.The doomed couple is now the focus of a nationwide manhunt that ultimately results in just retribution for their crimes.""Gun Crazy"" is a taut thriller that creatively uses the psychological profiles of the main players to formulate a plot revealing how negative influences can result in criminal behavior.

One thing is certain: there's exactly *one* funny line of dialogue and it's nice that Larry Fine has it. I won't spill the beans (or the nuts).This is really a showcase for Ted Healey, a real showman with an impressive baritone singing voice and a knack for off-mike muttering (once in a while something mildly amusing is audible). Of course, he's the original Stooge Supervisor but in this 1930 movie he and ""the boys"" do not have much time together on film. Harry [aka Moses/Moe], Shemp, and Larry, have alot of nutty business, but without the benefit of technology, meaning the kind of editing and sound-effects available later in the decade from the one company that could really put together a slapstick short - Columbia, they sometimes get lost in the din.Stooges fans and historians can get a strong sense of the Stooges live on stage from this awkward entry.A big problem is that practically every character is supposed to be funny, including one called ""Whispering Willie"", a ghoulish little figure (who also manages to play a mean zylophone!) who has one decent gag in the latter half of the film. His part is overdrawn - it's like watching a Keystone Kop pratfall every twelve seconds. Also, there's an ill-conceived scene involving a burning building and people in need of rescue. The actors continue to wisecrack while lives are at stake. Bad stuff.Also for Stooge-philes, there are plot elements which one could reasonably assume found their way onto later classics like ""False Alarms"" and ""Flat-Foot Stooges""; later, for a few bits on The Ed Wynne Show.",1.0,0,19,4,68,0,1,1791,302,1,0.1235423430735931,0.5,64.95,118.18,0.16065159177207877,0.002701999189234394,0.002696865012047258,0.2969614982779764,0.5369880457486631,0.01060859854829704,0.0005580357142857143,3,3.5,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,,long,

Poor Valerie's fifteen minutes of fame were up quickly.  The impression I recall of her was that of very disturbed, unattractive person.Valerie Solanas, as portrayed by the brilliant Lilli Taylor, is a whole different person. Yes she does some horrible things but she does them in such a defiant spirit, with so much wit and even charm, that we, the viewers are pulled in to root for her.  At least I was.  This is my main objection to the film---the glamorization of someone who was beyond pathetic.  It's customary Hollywood practice---Bonny and Clyde were not nearly as beautiful as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway; I don't know what Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid looked like but I doubt they came close to Newman and Redford.  I've never seen a Mafia guy come close to the charm and looks of Brando or Pacino, etc. etc. etc.But this is an important Indie Film.  Aren't they supposed to be truthful and beyond the gimmicks of Hollywood?  Was it the purpose of the film maker to garner our sympathy for Solanas and/or her beliefs by portraying her by this charming, perky and even cute actress?  Would the real Solanas have approved?  Who knows?Warhol and his scene were fascinating for many.  There is a much better documentary of his life which gives a view of the Factory that seems more believable.  Warhol was a very smart man, even a genius, and there must have been more appeal to the place than the silliness than is shown in this film.If you're looking for a realistic picture of Valerie Solanas, I don't think this is it.  If you're looking for a realistic view of this time of Warhol's life, I think you can find better elsewhere.  Still, if you don't care about accuracy, this is an interesting film.  Taylor's performance is worth seeing and Jarred Harris, as Warhol, is very good too.",0.0,0,35,5,59,4,0,1957,345,1,0.20562585034013606,0.5,70.84,49.48,0.0024718214182950803,0.002459842671804668,0.0024481545227787458,0.3445046860888733,0.6481154952982482,0.01788451711803781,0.0,6,4.0,0.022464,0.0,0.0,,long,

More than that, it's the story of one man, Harry Caul, a master ""bugger,"" a terribly damaged soul, who is practially isolated  from real life and who now lives mostly for his work. He tries, in his stiff and stilted way, to have a personal life;he has a girlfriend of sorts, a sweet but pathetic young woman whom he supports in a shabby room.  He tries to join in the post-convention party, has a few drinks, dances with a callgirl but even that sad attempt at human contact ends up in disaster.The story is brilliantly told, giving us, the audience, just enough information to keep our attention riveted to the screen.  We discover, bit by bit, just as Harry does, what is really going on with the young couple who is walking around Union Square.  Harry's credo is that he never gets personally involved in his survelliance work; he just does what he's ordered to do and collects the money.  His assistant, Stan, is a much more human guy and gets interested in the content of the conversation.  ""It's just normal"", he says.  But Harry isn't normal and we see how this particular job breaks open his defenses to the point where he takes direct action out of personal motives.There's so much that's good in this film but there are enough other reviews here that go into detail so I won't. Gene Hackman is wonderful in what must have been a terribly difficult role. The whole cast is very good. I particularly liked the very small but crucial parts played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest.  We see the film of them over and over so we get a very good opportunity to look at their facial expressions.  Forrest especially plays his part superbly.  Harrison Ford has another small but very interesting role and he makes the most of it.  Teri Garr is always good, as is John Cazale.I was reminded of a very similar film, made decades later, in Germany, ""The Story of Others"" which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  In this film, the main character is another single, isolated, middle-aged man, whose profession is to spy on possible traitors to the East German government, during the Cold War.  This man is even more far-gone than the Hackman character; his apartment is infinitely more sterile, and his social life is absolutely nothing.  But, like his American counterpart, one of his assignments has him snooping into the lives of a pair of lovers.  The love expressed in this couple, both of whom are artists and live a colorful, vibrant life, totally unlike that of the spy, makes something click inside his mind which leads to a similar, even more crucial, moral dilemma.I actually liked ""The Lives of Others"" much better than ""The Conversation"" becuase it went much farther and had more heart. I hope that Coppola saw it and I have to wonder what he thought.  I think it's because The Conversation"" doesn't live up to ""The Lives of Others"" that I reluctantly give it only four stars.  I liked it very much but I can't say that I loved it.  For me, the ending didn' work well.  Coppola said that it wasn't the ending he originally wrote but that difficulties in filming made his first ending impossible.  I think the difference in the endings of the two films accounts for why I liked this one but loved the other.",0.0,0,37,6,104,0,0,3412,604,1,0.19185782382411593,0.45,68.6,48.47,0.0012277993566425706,0.040986987895258564,0.001224851328697371,0.6665670591766165,0.28999330224278486,0.010844079718640093,0.0,6,4.0,0.016848,0.0,0.0,,long,

Forget the cartoony fiascos that were Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  Christopher Nolan's sweeping tale of one man's quest to bring justice to a dying, corrupt city is deadlocked with Sin City as 2005's best movie.  Odd how two motion pictures inspired by the work of Frank Miller are so far the most memorable and entertaining films to hit theaters this year.It doesn't hurt that the main focus in Batman Begins isn't gaudy set design, extravagant costumes, or a deep rooted desire to imitate; the number one priority is story.  Taking almost, if not all of, the humanizing elements of the Batman character and infusing it with an astounding balance of realism and comic book action, moviegoers the world over are in for something of a rarity, a superhero movie not dumbed down for the supposedly simple masses.  That a big budget summer blockbuster not only delivers on the action front but comes equipped with such a well written script has to be something of a studio fluke.  Hopefully a new trend in filmmaking has emerged, the smart action film.Don't worry for all you folks just looking for slam-bang intensity, this Batman ain't no codpiece wearing wuss. From Bruce Wayne's martial arts training to the jaw dropping capabilities of the Batmobile, the onscreen fisticuffs and pyrotechincs are enough to necessitate a drool cup for any hardcore action junkie.Batman Begins also delivers a sucker punch in the casting department.  Christian Bale gives us the most believable and downright scary Batman to date.  Michael Caine is eerily convincing as Alfred.  Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow proves his mettle and gives rise to an overall feeling of unease regarding psychiatric professionals everywhere.  Liam Neeson, although seemingly typecast in the mentor role of Henri Ducard, as always makes you believe he knows what he's talking about.  Morgan Freeman, well, he could recite Suess and it would be awesome; his Lucius Fox is way more believable (and a hell of a lot less annoying) than James Bond's Q. Katie Holmes as determined young District Attorney Rachel Dawes puts an exponential Grand Canyon gap between her and the teenybopper Dawson's Creek role that made her famous.  Tom Wilkinson as gangster Carmine Falcone proves once again that he's one of the best actors out there (don't believe me go rent In the Bedroom).  Now everyone mentioned above gives at worst an admirable turn, and this ensemble cast is a director's fantasy come true.  But there's one performance that's so surprisingly, unexpectedly good, I'd say it deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar right now.Gary Oldman as the up and coming Gotham City police officer Jim Gordon gives the performance of his already stellar career.  In a departure from his previous psychos and deviants Oldman plays his honest cop to unerring perfection.  We feel his conflict and his discomfort as he continues on the straight and narrow in a city filled with venomous curves.  He's Batman's number one fan and also his number one ally.  Oldman plays the workingman hero, the average Joe, the family man who keeps his head down to keep his loved ones safe; he not only nails it he redefines the archetype.Batman Begins is the must see movie of the summer.  I'm hoping word of mouth on this cinematic masterpiece will bring it well deserved box office success.  Extremely rich storytelling along with phenomenal character development should keep folks coming back.  I'm doubtful there will be a better movie released this year, at least one involving superheroes.Parents please take note, almost the entire film revolves around the concept of fear and accordingly there are some frightening elements and intense images.  Batman Begins definitely earns its PG-13 rating, so if your little tykes have a nightmare tendency you might want to check this out first before you bring them along.",0.3333333333333333,2,28,5,85,0,0,3936,648,1,0.1678985366485366,-0.15,58.72,117.16,0.0011295857235094633,0.051722189222235274,0.17739170386752048,0.6486770310741998,0.121079490112535,0.007113821138211382,8.466683600033866e-05,2,5.0,0.15552,0.25,0.6666666666666666,4.8,long,

Charlie may be many things--but he is not a snitch and he won't tell the principal and his parents (Leslie Hope, David Schofield), who was with him stealing the purse.Instead of being expelled, the principal offers Charlie the chance to work off his debt with the victim (Gena Rowland).  When Charlie goes to her home, he learns she's a widow who believes her late husband James haunts her garden and is raising two mentally challenged boys--one which she's adopted.Mrs. Ritchie sets Charlie to work in her garden--teaching him about how to grow things and consideration for what he plants in his garden.  (what you sow, you shall reap)  Through her kindness, he learns to understand his own issues and stand up for himself and his family.""Mrs Ritchie"" is a good film and worth seeing at least once, particularly if you are a strong fan of Gena Rowland.  She is luminious in this film--very believable and in my opinion, what makes the film work.",0.5,1,32,7,53,0,0,1324,230,1,0.07125000000000001,0.0,75.64,106.67,0.0032442184665355664,0.08792208828513536,0.0032450634039061996,0.9023081524056575,0.003280477438765292,0.02416918429003021,0.0003773584905660377,6,3.8,0.007344,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

But don't believe the hype!,"I hate to diss on this movie, but it's gotta be done in the hopes of sparing someone their hard earned duckets on this over-hyped film! I have been looking forward to getting a look at this pick since Maxim ranked it above even the great Dawn of the Dead within one of their schlock movie articles a few years back. Better than even the great DOTD? That's quite a claim! I thought I had really been missing out by having never seen ""Near Dark""... Boy was I wrong!It is not a total stinker... But to call this flick gorier than the legendary Dawn of the Dead or any of the Evil Dead flicks is pure fantasy and/or ignorance.... Then again I have to ponder how many peeps calling this flick so ""gory"" and ""great"" just happen to work at Anchor Bay who released this DVD? I mean is it possible anyone can talk outta thier ...that much? Anyways, the bottom line on gore in this flick... Don't expect anything more than some fake blood! There's a part where a character get's shot in the stomach, and all you see is fake blood on a torn shirt! What no entrails? How dare anyone comapre this to DOTD! Any TRUE schlock fan can name a thousand titles with more gore than this flick!But gore is not everything... What about story?I thought the premise was cool! These vampires cruising around mid-west americana in stolen vehicles... Blacking out the windows with aluminum foil and black spraypaint so they can cruise around in the day. But continuously I kept wondering when the movie was going to pick up! Then the totally rushed ending that basically smacks of writer's conveinence by rehashing part of the beginning like an inane instant replay! What? That's it? I guess so... And another title to collect dust on my collection shelf. No wonder it was a ""forgotten"" film! Well it will maintain that status in my collection. ;)Pros? Bill Paxton I thought gave the only standout performance in the movie... He was really that damn good as Severen! The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was pretty good... But not as great as their efforts for  ""The Keep""... But definitely an above average soundtrack for a low budget horror flick though. And the much touted ""Bar-Scene"" was by far the most interesting scene in this flick. Sort of reminded me of the opening scene in Natural Born Killers. But is this DVD worth the purchase for these few perks? Hell no! At least in my opinion! To sum it up... Does not live up to the hype by a longshot... And is rather a boring film. Not horrible... but none too great!Please, by all means... If you are like me and haven't seen this flick, but are considering buying it based on the hype alone.... Do rent before buying!

Soon enough she starts recieving phone calls of a woman who claims she is from the past and desperatly needs a friend. Unlucky for Mary the woman is also seriously disturbed and soon uses the past to destroy Mary's present.The Caller would be something Rod Serling would write in his worse days. The film isn't intelligent nor is it scary in anyway imaginable but it's also perfectly watchable. The film does manage an impressive little atmosphere throughout and there are a few decent albeit confusing plot twists here and there but it just never elevates to anything above average. It just simmers until it's eye roll worthy final scene and never takes off. Rod Serling would rightfully trash this one amazon shoppers and start from scratch!The Caller also struggles to properly identify itself. You'll groan as you notice every part of town needs better lighting. You'll mutter when the lead sees a figure in her old photos she just never noticed before. Really the list goes on and on but I don't have all night ;)  Maybe if The Caller had a few more capable people behind the camera  and a much more talented screenwriter with ides of his own then we would've got a more satisfying finished product.But even if I was hard on it it's not all bad really!

I'm really at a loss for how some of the other reviewers were disappointed.

It's funnier, for one thing. The comedy has better delivery, the characters are more solid, and the story more clear.It is very easy to sympathize with these characters despite all their faults, dishonesty, and criminal behavior. Don't be mistaken - there are some very human moments to offset the funny parts. There are many one-liners, quips, arguments, friendly insults, physical humor, scheming, and the overall situation of never getting things quite right during an attempted heist.What a great cast too - every one of them perfectly selected for their roles.

H. Berry's is a psychiatrist who, after a car accident caused by ghostly girl, awakes locked up in her own ward and blamed for her beloved husband's murder, which she obviously can't remember committing. As she struggles to remember (in a performance that makes you wonder about that `Berry' Oscar), horrid things start happening and the 'suspense' supposedly mounts. What mounts is our annoyance with the film, that boasts decent direction (which elevates &quot;Gothika&quot; above Dark Castle's previous sordid efforts like &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; and &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;) and stylized sets - and everything else trying to live up to it...

I hadn't read about the Belieski brothers, although I have read a lot of stories behind World War II. I will say up front, now that I have done the research post movie-viewing, that the movie doesn't match the true story that closely. That being said, my title rings true.Taken out of the context of all the true details of the story, the movie is cohesive, tight, yet broad in scope. The storyline is simple; three brothers each react differently to the death of the other members of their family, and the deaths of their friends -- and how they ultimately survive the horror of being hunted by both Nazis and their own countrymen eager to turn them in for rewards from the Nazis. What they do to survive, what they do to help others survive, and how they differ is what gives the movie its depth.I was overwhelmed by the acting of Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber. Both are tour-de-force acting chops by actors that are already good. And the young actor, Jamie Bell, shows great promise if he grows into his potential shown here. The supporting roles, mostly played by virtual unknowns, and the location filming in Lithuania make for a surprisingly valid movie experience.While there are quibbles, and not a few anachronisms, overall I'd have no problem seeing this movie again and again.",0.0,0,41,7,39,0,0,1360,239,1,0.18444616977225672,0.0,68.3,81.29,0.03206515735076167,0.2577519263346869,0.0030041964870840166,0.5601434762382141,0.14703524358925316,0.030147058823529412,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.666666666666667,long,

A modern day classic that's actually a throwback to thrilling 1960's and '70's Saturday matinee popcorn fare.  A filmmaker's love letter to giant monster movies and Japanese television live action and cartoon mecha-oriented shows.  And director Guillermo del Toro makes this one visually sumptuous, incredibly technically-minded slug-fest between man operating his mega-machines and an onslaught of ridiculously big giant alien monsters.Earth's major cities have been savaged and ravaged by an unpredictable horde of giant monsters (kaiju) originating from deep within the Pacific ocean, from some interdimensional rift.  Mankind suffered heavy casualty and calamity at their hands in this ongoing war but tides began to turn as they created Jaegers (pronounced &#34;yay - grrs&#34;), giant robots with incredible arsenals and stupendous power, piloted by a pair of humans who have to be able to share each other's memories, movements, and mind in a simpatico fashion.  But budgets and support dwindled threatening the Jaeger program and now the kaiju are back on the attack and are showing themselves to be ever more powerful.  Can the Jaeger's stop the kaiju?  Can humanity figure out how to shut down the rift?  Is the earth going to be overrun by a malevolent force?There are light touches of humor in the film, heavier doses of drama though not stifling or the main focus which is kept firmly on the fantasy aspect of the film.  And the special effects and delivery are top notch.  This is a safe movie for most kids, free from hardened profanity and rampant sex, and the violence is mostly leveled at the Jaegers and kaiju (though there is a small amount between human combatants by way of a bad blood fistfight and in a sparring session).  This film is all around solid.And the DVD release has seen a variety of offers both lavish and plain.  For enthusiasts of this type of genre I highly recommend the 2 disc special edition that contains a second disc devoted solely to special features that cover all of the typical bases but gives one the sense of just how daunting a task this film was to see to fruition.  del Toro is a master director IMO, up there with the Spielbergs and Jacksons.",0.0,0,46,9,54,3,0,2236,374,1,0.1215718945406445,0.3,57.71,79.26,0.16650868560189597,0.13654003427386077,0.18555670740551833,0.5090984667576981,0.0022961059610268914,0.020572450805008944,0.0,2,3.0,0.0014688,0.0,0.0,3.4285714285714284,long,

Sure, Pixar have an unbroken track record including A Bug's Life which, on release, was unjustly compared to Toy Story and has always lived unfairly in it's shadow. Sure, the premise of a family of super heroes returning to work after a prolonged absence is high-concept enough to hold an interesting story (not to mention Pixar's now famous comedy writing). And sure, the trailer is funnier and better made than a lot of the films it has had the misfortune to precede (it was the only thing worth seeing at The Haunted Mansion). But let's look at the facts...Several months ago, during the fine-tuning of this film, Pixar announced it's split from Disney. Disney had given Pixar it's leg-up only to see it's offspring out-perform it in every way. Shrewd as ever, Disney had got an iron-clad contract with Pixar for a seven-picture deal as well as, important this, control of all of the characters created for the films. This means that all hopes of the often rumored Toy Story 3 are shattered unless it is made without Pixar's involvement - and, considering Disney's output lately, I for one would prefer to not see it happen at all. Of course Disney, never one to shy from flogging a dead horse (Pocahontas 2 anyone?!), will immediately start churning out garbage featuring Woody, Flik, Sully and Nemo for a quick buck. This will be Pixar's sixth film for Disney (with Cars to follow next year) and it's possible that the fruitlessness of working FOR Disney as opposed to WITH them, may have made the folks at Pixar a little less willing to produce top-quality fayre. However, this would seem to be cutting one's nose of to spite one's face since Pixar would do well to maintain their high-standard so that when they leave Disney they leave with a better reputation than their 'parent' company. This will definately leave Disney with an 'empty nest' feeling. An empty nest that will soon be filled by Chicken Little - apparently Disney's move to produce all of it's theatrical features in CGI - the sounds you hear are Uncle Walt spinning and people snorting in disgust as they remember Disney's Dinosaur.Also, for your consideration, is the competition. Finding Nemo knocked King Simba's crown off the top of the box-office charts only to have it picked up recently by a flatulent green ogre. Shrek 2 has shown that Disney and Pixar are not the only two names in animation and with many more studios jumping on the bandwagon we can only hope that Pixar don't suffer the same fate as Disney has over the past few years. The makers of Shrek 2 have already credited Toy Story of being the daddy, calling it the ""Snow White of CGI"". Let's hope that Pixar doesn't become the ""Disney of CGI"", which would have been a compliment as recently as 1997, but which now sadly isn't.I hold my hopes high and proud for The Incredibles. I do the same for Cars and all of Pixar's future output - they deserve it.The bile that I spit in the direction of Disney is fuelled by love and frustration - not hate. I am a long time fan and DVD competist - I even bought Treasure Planet! I just hope they know what they're doing and  do it well. If anyone from Disney reads this please remember:- STORY FIRST! We love gorgeous animation but hate style over content.

I really enjoyed this movie in the theater when I saw it, so I decided to buy it on DVD. When I saw this movie in the theater I liked it alot, but it wasn't what I expected to see. I thought it was going to be a serious slasher type  horror flick, but it turned out to be what I thought was a cheesy horror flick that was so bad it was funny and fun to watch.I admit when I saw the movie a second time on DVD I liked it even more! Now I understand that this wasn't supposed to be a serious horror flick, but rather a dark morbid comedy in a horror movie setting.As others have mentioned, this movie is about a flesh eating virus. The cast plays a bunch of graduated college kids who take a vacation (somewhere in the south)in the cabin. Certain things happen that leave them stranded at the cabin, which is not good news since the virus is spreading.This is an adult movie. Lots of strong language, some nudity and lots of blood. Usually I find it hard to respect movies that have these adult themes, but it all makes Cabin Fever the great movie that it is. Rider Strong from boy meets world leads the cast with a excellent performance and the rest of the cast is great too!This DVD has some nice special features including The family friendly version and Chick Vision. All the special features clue you into the fact that Cabin Fever is not a horror movie, but a dark comedy horror film.. For example the chick vision feature throws some virtual hands over the movie screen to block out the scary parts.I had 2 dissapointments. One is that the DVD didn't have a alternate ending. The ending in the movie I like because I am such a fan, but many people will not like it!

This film is an infantile search for a comforting and powerful mother goddess. This isn't religion; it is superstition. The role of Mary is critical to the life of Jesus.

It's an interesting premise that ultimately doesn't work with Bresson's minimalist style. The film is somewhat effective, especially the scenes showing the donkey's love and mistreatment by humans. However, because Bresson's direction doesn't allow for ""acting"" in the typical sense, the only character that comes accross as real is the donkey. The non-professional actors are nicely cast, but they are never allowed to express themselves clearly, and the film becomes an examination of boredom and sadness. Bresson's attempt at bringing religous undertones and symbolism to a donkey's life is a truly original idea, but his directing style causes this intersting tale to become an act of tediousness that never allows the viewer to feel for the donkey, or the human race who persecutes it.",0.42857142857142855,8,43,7,25,0,0,899,142,1,0.19345238095238096,0.0,38.96,73.85,0.004825270483764588,0.004844759497844773,0.004840474260902377,0.9806093054052542,0.004880190352234191,0.047830923248053395,0.0004761904761904762,2,3.0,0.0002592,0.4,3.4285714285714284,,long,

Directed by Tom Savini; it stars Tony Todd, Patricia Tallman and Tom Towles. For this remake, Romero rewrote the original screenplay with John A. Russo(whom he had originally wrote it with). Most of the film was handled by the same team as the original, with the exception that directing duties were handled by famed special make-up effects artist Tom Savini, who originally signed up with hopes of doing the make-up effects as he was not able to for the original film as he had military duty.It tells the story of a group of people who fend off hordes of the walking dead in a secluded farmhouse in Western Pennsylvania, only fueding between themselves which proves to be just as deadly.  The story follows the same core story of the original but with slight alterations & changes. It was made on a budget of $4,200,000 but proves that great movies can be made on low budgets.Despite the fact that, when it was released, it garnered negative reactions from the general public; I personally thought it was great film for its' time. Tom Savini did a pretty decent job directing the film and, in my opinion, actually improved on certain things and commentary about the time in the film.Even though zombie fans of today are more discriminating in their tastes in zombie movies, this is a worthy remake of an old classic that every zombie fan should have in their collection.

I really enjoyed some films by director Gus Van Zandt, like ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""To Die For""; but, after he remade Hitchcock's classic ""Psycho"", I don't care if he ever makes another film again. First of all, this is a film that does not need to be remade. Especially a shot for shot COLOR (?) remake. Hitch shot ""Psycho"" in B&W; on purpose! He had a reason for not using color in the film. And, for Gus Van Zandt not to get that just proves that he has no clue as to what made Hitch's masterpiece of cinema a classic to begin with, no idea of what made that film such a classic that it still is today.Not only is the film as flat as a penny on a train track, but for some unknown reason, Van Zandt felt the need to insert completely unneccesary shots, like storm clouds, and (what was he thinking?!?!) scenes of Norman masturbating while he's peeping. That was very offensive to any fan of the original, because the suspense is now replaced with repulsion! But, to me, the ultimate crime was at the end: Instead of freeze framing on the liscence plate of the car as it is being pulled from the marsh, Van Zandt for God knows what reason allows his camera to keep rolling, letting the scene play out during the duration of credits. What a travesty to anything Hitchcock!!People have slammed director Brian DePalma for borrowing from Hitchcock (one of the many reasons that I love DePalma!), and some have even declared his classic ""Dressed To Kill"" a ""Psycho"" rip off; but, at least it had a very new and fresh angle. Even DePalma wouldn't be as stupid as to try and remake a Hitchcock classic. There is no need when you can still watch the original films by the Master Of Suspense, available in most stores and Amazon on VHS and/or DVD.Van Zandt should be hung in a public square for tampering with this timeless classic! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your time with this piece of garbage! If you haven't seen ""Psycho"", seek out the original version and see what everyone is talking about when it comes to one of the best psychological suspense mystery thrillers ever made.

(even though I just think Daniel Craig is sexy even when he acts fake.)The book was much more enjoyable and I'd certainly wait until the DVD if you're really that interested, but I'm was just passing the time and I'm glad I went to an early showAlthough I'm kind of disappointed I still spent any money on it.Grade: C - -",0.5,4,48,8,31,0,0,839,161,1,0.27701863354037265,-0.09999999999999999,76.76,80.28,0.003960470632961297,0.0039694986165504055,0.2933959765322683,0.003927171696978492,0.6947468825212415,0.057210965435041714,0.0005952380952380953,1,,0.0,0.4444444444444444,2.0,,long,

Of course ABC and the makers of this show have brought a lot of that on themselves with storylines that provide far more questions than answers and a scheduling system that would have killed most weaker shows. Though after we work our way through all that nonsense we find a show that is fine but ultimately overrated. Maybe people love this show as though it was the perfect specimen that they wish it was.  After busting down the gates with two strong episodes to open the series which lay out for us strong characters and strong groundwork the show loses its new show luster very quickly. I'm sure JJ Abrams and company would have you believe that this show is far more cinematic than episodic but I'm not so easily convinced. Too many episodes fall into the trap of being mysteries that need to be solved in 43 minutes. Who burned down the raft? Who poisoned Michael? What is this, freakin' ""Murder She Wrote""?The story, for those that don't know, involves a bunch of people who get on a plane which goes down in the middle of nowhere, stranding them on an island that is apparently on nobodies map. Then weird stuff starts to happen. A polar bear shows up. They find some crazy French chick with a taste for torture. Jack (Matthew Fox, strong in this role) takes over as natural leader of the pack. They try to play it up as though he needs to be a leader to get over his daddy issues but I wasn't really buying that. More realistically the good suits at ABC probably picked him out to be the leader because they wanted a clean cut, attractive white male to get top billing. There are a lot of characters here and by painting them fairly broadly (the Iraqi, the hot girl, the fat guy) they are able to produce legitimately strong people. We learn about them slowly over the season through flashbacks to their previous lives. These flashbacks were widely criticized as simply slowing down the plot, but let's look at this situation from a different angle. This is a huge season (large even by network TV drama standards) at 1068 minutes, could they really fill all that out, and 5 seasons afterwards, with just island life? Especially considering how tame this island life is (no raping!). The story moves towards two climaxes. One involves a set of characters who build a raft and set sail for freedom into the wild blue yonder. The other revolves around a mysterious hatch found buried deep in the jungle and what exactly it contains.Along the way the plots vary in quality. Claire getting kidnapped provides a perfect mini arch right in the middle of the season. I also enjoyed most anything Sawyer was involved in because even though I generally hate Texas racists he was at least pragmatic compared to the rest of the day dreamers. Too often I found the flashbacks to be too closely related to what was happening in real time. Their poetic coincidence was my network TV contrivance. Also, as could be expected, the plane roster was unusually attractive and unusually interesting. Where are the lazy bums like me who would watch a show like this? So in conclusion this show is certainly not my favorite, it is an ambitious, original concept that still needs to work out the kinks.",0.5714285714285714,6,36,6,71,5,1,3363,599,1,0.1680758199276718,0.05,69.92,8.2,0.0013618184351136418,0.0013531910499370416,0.30741487385569183,0.43067492988184847,0.25919518677740905,0.010704727921498661,0.00016986580601324953,1,,0.0,0.5333333333333333,3.4285714285714284,5.0,long,

It's not one of the romantic comedies he was famous for in his early career. ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is serious stuff. Grant stars as Geoff Carter who, along with owner Dutchy, runs a freight airline company in some unnamed South American country. Planes and pilots are constantly being lost in the savage weather and the flight over the Andes mountains.The team has become jaded and callous as one after another pilot is killed and basically, quickly forgotten. It seems like a cruel world but we see the crew has to be hardened to survive the constant loss of coworkers. Geoff constantly sends pilots to almost certain doom in dangerous weather all in the name of business and the hopes of winning an important contract.A lot of the flying and plane crashes are special effects using models. This probably was super high tech for 1939 but looks very dated now. The few scenes of planes actually flying close to mountains are stunning.Although we seem to be in some remote outpost, ships do show up at the part and before we know it, perky Jean Arthur and the ravishingly lovely Rita Hayworth are in the picture. Both women are objects of Geoff's attention but he always seems the stoic gentleman.It's odd that Arthur and Hayworth are key characters but both seem to come and go. Arthur seems to completely disappear for a while and suddenly she is back.ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is another colloboration of Cary Grant and director Howard Hawks. Hawks and Grant made several films together and they seem to have been a good match for film. The film seems particularly long at over 2 hours and seriously repetitious as planes go up and come down (not always in a good way). I wondered how many planes this small airline had and how they could keep operating after each loss.Although I think the film is lacking in substance on occasion, it has a remarkable cast of talented actors. The stars a famous and the film is filled with classic character actors that I have seen in countless films. It's a different pace for Cary Grant and a chance to look at him from a different perspective.",0.0,0,31,6,35,0,0,2142,379,1,0.10409658899020602,0.0,70.94,90.77,0.07595462251447183,0.00276297764900748,0.002768498134562133,0.7040966923451182,0.2144172093568404,0.014472455648926238,0.0,2,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

The younger generation may not recognize Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, Jack Gilford or Buster Keaton but they are among the greats and seeing them together is a pure joy. Add in a very young Michael Crawford and the early work of musical great Stephen Sondheim and it's a film not to be missed.Although there are a few songs, the film version of A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM doesn't feel like a musical. It's more slapstick comedy with some songs thrown in. Slapstick comedy can get tiring after a while, so try to stick with the film. Silent screen legend Buster Keaton is here in his last film role. Although he lights up the screen in his brief appearances, he really deserved so much more on-screen time.  FORUM follows a comedic format of slapstick bordering on the absurd that was popular in the early to mid 1960's. This genre doesn't stand up well as the years have passed but film buffs will appreciate the effort.It's ancient Rome and a young man (Crawford) as the not so aptly-named Hero, is in love with the virgin next door. It's more complicated than it sounds. The house next door is one of ill-repute and the virgin has been sold to a great warrior who will take her far away from Hero. It's up to Hero and his slave Pseudolus(Mostel) to save her. Let the slapstick begin. One of the gags involves Gilford (already past middle age) dressing up as the young female virgin. While in costume he attracts the amorous interest of a Roman Soldier. Are we surprised? Didn't THE THREE STOOGES already do that gag a number of times? Well, Gilford pulls off the gag with confidence.The scenery, setting and costumes are of top quality so FORUM is a fun film to watch. It's a bittersweet combination of talents in their twightlight years and others just beginning glorious careers. FORUM can be silly but also fun. It's a must for fans of old-style comedy but it won't appeal to modern audiences hooked on comedies of today. A lot is lacking by today's standards but FORUM still has the ability to entertain.",1.0,0,51,9,56,2,0,2200,399,1,0.16149501661129564,0.55,80.62,79.26,0.18448418744518819,0.13520201144442787,0.0019471760271769169,0.525546538251945,0.15282008683126203,0.023181818181818182,0.00045433893684688776,2,,0.0343008,0.5,0.0,,long,

This will definitely hinder the playing of the DVD and may even cause your player harm. If you find it excessive (or at all, if you wish) or on many DVDs, you should return for replacement.FYI: CDs/DVDs have 2 protective coatings over the actual digital content.

They are either very good (Superman) or very bad (The Hulk). X-Men 2, is probably my favorite Super Hero film. It doesn't even compare to the first movie. That is so rare for a sequel. Aside from Halle Berry, the rest of the cast is enjoyable and fun to watch. We really get to delve deeper into their universe and deeper into certain characters. We learn more about Wolverine, Prof X, and Jean Grey, just some of my favorite characters. Nightcrawler is also a fun new character. The plot is quite interesting and engaging.

I canceled my order, and put the discs on my Netflix queue instead to evaluate them before purchase.Well, I re-ordered the set. Let me tell you why.The Films:The Trek films, to my mind, are a very good capstone to the Original Series Trek characters' stories. In them, we are presented with a very good ""trilogy"" of sorts, ST2-4, and a few other films that retain the thematic elements of the others whilst enjoying varying quality of story.The Motion Picture (ST1) is unfairly maligned in my eyes. It very ably presents a story of characters re-uniting after a hiatus, with all the varying emotional consequences of that separation. Grafted to this is a relatively high-concept science fiction tale of an artificial intelligence seeking its creator. If this film had been cut by 20 minutes (very long effects sequences which seem a deliberate paean to Kubrick's ""2001""), people would be hailing it as a masterpiece.ST2: The Wrath of Khan is, of course, the public's pick as the greatest Trek film. It's hard to argue. A good villain, a deep emotional core, a slam-bang space battle, and some great performances make this a film that doesn't really misfire.ST3: The Search For Spock is the middle act of a ""trilogy"", and really works in my opinion. It has a lot of action, a good dose of humor, and a lot of heart.ST4: The Voyage Home is unbridled fun from start to finish. Lighter in tone than the preceding two films, it still captures the emotional core of the story, and brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.ST5: The Final Frontier is the black sheep of the family. It introduces an unfortunate ""retcon"" character, does some unrealistic things in its quest to reach the ""center of the galaxy,"" and posits an unsatisfying sci-fi story about ""finding god."" The characterizations are still generally good, though, and there are plenty of charming moments for fans.ST6: The Undiscovered Country is a return to form of sorts, but I think would not be regarded as highly if it had not followed ST5. A cold-war allegory, it has some good action, but suffers from some silly sequences in the middle (a prison planet and a murder mystery spring to mind). It does have Captain Sulu, though, which is hard to dislike.The Blu-Ray:Well, first I'll list the negatives:We are not presented with the ""directors editions"" from the last DVD box set. Thus we miss some new effects shots from ST1, one very good bit of back story from ST2, and a few negligible cuts from the rest of the films (mainly 6).Digital Noise Reduction has been applied to at least the final 4 films - and the results are not always positive. Grain has been reduced from the films with negative results - some very fine detail (such as fine facial wrinkles) is scrubbed away also. It probably will not be noticeable on displays under 40 inches - and I imagine it would be quite noticeable on front projection screens above 80 inches. I personally noticed it in spots on my 50"" display, especially on Star Trek 4. ST4 comes off by far the worst, with many faces looking waxy - and other scenes being artificially pumped up by edge enhancement to compensate (check out Kirk and Spock walking by the boat dock before Gillian picks them up). I would say ST4 and ST6 suffer the most by the out of control noise reduction. You can really see it when smoke is in a scene - check out the scene in ST6 when Kirk smokes a cigar. As the smoke wafts in front of his face, you can see pores and lines under the eyes that are absent in the very next shot sans smoke. It's that extra little layer of detail we could have had, and it's missing.The double dip conundrum: we are certain to be presented with a new set, although I will go on record betting it won't be before Xmas 2010, if even that soon. Paramount will be putting out the Abrams film this year, Seasons 2-3 of TOS this year, and the TNG movies probably next year. Surely there will be a complete box set at some point, incorporating the ""directors edition"" footage, but I would guess that this will not be released until the 2nd Abrams film hits theaters. It seems to takes upwards of a year to re-transfer and restore a film, the Directors footage has to be re-shot in 1080p, and logically, Paramount would not cannibalize their current retail SKUs by so quickly re-releasing them. So I would guess 2012 would be the soonest we'd see the ""directors editions"" with new, hopefully less DNR'ed transfers.All right, now the good news:These films have never looked this good. NEVER. ST1 is revelatory - there are colors I've never seen, and DNR is not obtrusive at all - fine detail seems quite evident. ST2, which apparently had the latest transfer, does not suffer from excessive DNR. ST3-6 are the films that have the most aggressive noise reduction, but it is only noticeable in select scenes (I am watching on a 50"" 1080p display). For the most part, detail is quite strong (especially for movies shot in the 1980s), color depth blows away the DVDs (you really should compare them - prepare to be dazzled), and sound quality is excellent. The worst looking of these films look as good as the best cable TV HD. The best of them (1 and 2) are competitive with some of the better Blu-Rays on the market now. Just to correct some misinformation from previous reviews, all the films are presented in 1080p. None of them are 1080i, or anything less. Also, all of the films are truly high definition. They are not some sort of pseudo-HD, as one particularly egregious review has claimed.So it's hit or miss in terms of A/V, but light years ahead of the DVDs. The biggest gains are in color - the DVDs are positively muddy by comparison. ST 1, 2, and 5 generally look pretty good detail-wise. The other films suffer from waxy faces - they have strong mid-range detail (like cloth textures or scenery), but weak fine detail (like facial wrinkles). It is aggravating, because the films look so good in general, that the little details are washed away.Extras are VERY strong. Each film gets new commentaries, and most retain a second commentary as well. MANY new documentaries supplement the older ones which are retained for this set (I would estimate about 100 minutes per film combining old and new content). ""Library Computer"" offers interactive text data while you watch the films. BD Live functions include the ability to create and take fan quizzes with your remote and internet connection. The one giant new inclusion, ""The Captains Summit,"" is presented on its own disc in full HD quality. This is a 70 minute round table, hosted by Whoopie (Guinan) Goldberg, featuring actors William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart(Picard) and Jonathan Frakes (Riker). Wow! It is oddly titled, and I wish that they had included Kate Mulgrew (Janeway), Scott Bakula (Archer), and Avery Brooks (Sisko). The interview was a bit directionless at times, with Goldberg failing to keep her guests on track. Nonetheless, the actors are generally funny and at times engaging and insightful, and true fans will eat this up.Atypically for CBS/Paramount, the packaging for this set is very nice. A cardboard box with a plastic slipcover holds the Blu-Ray cases, which are all of the ""slim"" variety. Thus, the set takes up the space of only about 3 regular Blu-Ray cases, despite having seven discs. Separate cases, though, allow you to lend out one disc, and there is never any fumbling around with the elaborate multi-disc cases that often comprise these sets.******In summary, it comes down to a value proposition. At Amazon's reduced price, you're getting the theatrical cuts of the films, better than they've ever looked, for $11.65 apiece. I know I've paid more for films I care about a lot less. There probably won't be superior presentations of them for at least 3 years. So for a serious Trekkie, the math is simple. This is a purchase.For a general sci-fi fan with an HD setup, it's a maybe. If you're the type who's willing to buy ""Chronicles of Riddick"" for $20 just to have something HD to watch with spaceships and explosions, it's hard to see the argument against this set. If you're a new Trek fan who wants to dive in, this value is hard to beat. If you don't care much about Trek, this might be a pass, since intimate knowledge and interest for the characters really helps your enjoyment of the films.The haters need to calm down. No, this is not a perfect set. But at this price, it is still a very strong value. The missing material is not really integral to enjoying the films (unlike the LOTR set without the Extended Edition material - now THAT is a significant loss). If you want to see the films for the next 3 or 4 years at their best, this is the set to get. Otherwise, you're stuck with the dull, muddy DVD transfers for at least that long. When it comes time for the double-dip in 2012, the only ones that will probably warrant a re-purchase are 1 and 2, since they gained the most from the ""Directors Edition"" material.I would have rated this 3 stars had it been significantly more expensive, or had significantly fewer extras. But for $11-$13 (depending on the set's price) per movie, I'm willing to take the plunge, come what may. I think this set is a worthwhile purchase at either price point, and I would have placed the order at 79.99 as well.",0.9215686274509803,4,71,11,356,0,1,9402,1655,1,0.15506688506688507,0.5375,69.82,51.85,0.5130321277746165,0.00048038831214419357,0.23700358255769705,0.12586299652660526,0.12362090482893708,0.007551584769198043,9.800793655758592e-05,3,4.5,0.0,0.9038461538461539,3.6862745098039214,5.0,long,

It's a good, clean (mostly) action-adventure show with some great comedy and great characters. And it's for most ages - like an old-time cowboy serial.The story follows Brisco County Jr. (Campbell), a lawyer who turns bounty hunter when his father, a famed lawman, is gunned down in cold blood by the criminal gang of the infamous John Bly. Aided by his friends, the grumpy scout and tracker Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), cowardly Socrates Poole (Christian Celmenson), and Prof. Wiskwire (John Astin, who you may remember as Gomez Addams from the original Addams Family), Brisco is hired by a group of tycoons to bring Bly ot justice. In the process, Brisco becomes embroiled in the search for the mysterious and mystical Orb, an object of enormous occult power coveted by Bly. Along they way, Brisco has run-ins with the seductive chanteuse Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford) and Bly's wacky henchmen.What marks this show is its sense of fun. There are crazy inventions, weird villains (including a prairie pirate named - I kid you not - Blackbeard LeCut), cliffhangers, and everything else that makes adventure shows a great time. The jokes and puns come hard and fast, and the characters are nothing if not lovable - even Comet, Brisco's ""talking"" horse. Now, the whole science fiction element that is woven throughout the show is a little off-putting - it just doesn't seem to quite fit - but it doesn't detract too much from the program over all.

I must say I was quite disappointed.  I wasn't expecting another Blair Witch Project, but I did expect more creepiness and more of an actual story.  Halfway through the movie, I noticed the time and wondered when the movie was really going to start.  The ending was somewhat acceptable though less than unforeseen, but overall this movie reminds me of a patchwork quilt that someone forgot to actually sew together into one whole object.  The documentary format was weakened by a droll, unemotional, monotonous narration; the interviewed subjects also do not reveal any real attachment to the story.  When the film starts, the viewer is informed that the following people are not actors; ""(at least, not very good ones)"" could easily have been appended to that opening statement.  The sequence of the action is also questionable.  There is too much jumping around from one place and setting to another, and several scenes are annoyingly replayed several times; I would rather have been given a more sequential presentation.  As for the film shot by the participants in the pine barrens, the attention to realism possibly goes too far.  The video is totally unviewable much more often that it should be.  The conversations on the tapes are often unintelligible, and there are few decent background perspectives by which the viewer can orient himself.  The story of the recreation of the mangled tape that turned up long after the events is well-done, but the descriptions of just how difficult it is to reconstruct the images grow tedious, and the tape's ultimate revelation is less than earth-shattering.It is important to note that this movie preceded the Blair Witch Project and is thus in no way a Blair Witch clone.  Had Blair Witch never been released, this movie would probably fare much better than it does now; before Blair Witch it was a uniquely bad movie; now it is just a bad movie stripped of its uniqueness.  I did not find The Last Broadcast creepy at all and cannot recommend it for horror fans.  Nor can I recommend it for mock documentary aficionados.

By betraying his sacred pledge that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster.  Ni-Chang's fury over Cho's betrayal drives her completely mad, transforming her into the white-haired witch who lives only to destroy every living member of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs.  As for Cho, he has retreated to Mount Shin Fung, guarding over a mystical flower whose bloom (and it only blooms once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves.Ten years have passed since the deadly night that Ni-Chang went mad and almost single-handedly destroyed the Wu Tang clan.  Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has stood guard at Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho's nephew Kit (Sunny Chan).  With Kit's impending marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to further the bloodline exists - and so it is that Ni-Chang crashes the party, kidnaps the young bride, and takes her back to her own private castle full of man-hating, deadly women.  There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the witch's ""See a man, kill a man"" philosophy and programmed to kill Kit with her own hands.The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try and kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are all almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses her deadly hair as a most effective weapon (sounds weird, I know, but it works really well).  It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for a most unforgettable reunion between the two former lovers.This sequel is a more direct, action-oriented film than the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason I actually found it more enjoyable on the surface.  Still, though, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet again face to face until the final scene - although that meeting is well worth the wait.  Most certainly, if you've seen and enjoyed the original, you'll want to experience this sequel.",1.0,0,40,8,74,0,0,2260,389,1,0.16945970695970697,0.0,58.15,105.66,0.0024767015035441634,0.00248990048786013,0.002471872884781682,0.6265502856449996,0.36601123947881437,0.017699115044247787,0.0004422821760283061,6,3.0,0.00216,0.8571428571428571,0.0,,long,

Well then, Prince Talon in The Sword and the Sorcerer was waaaayyyy ahead of his time! Talon's triple-bladed sword not only would break any foe's single blade to pieces, it could launch two of its blades at its target(s).Not to be one-upped, Gillette has launched the five-blade, battery powered (use a Gillette owned Duracell AAA please) Fusion shaving system that features a patented on-board micro-chip to optimize performance by regulating voltage and frequency. Good God...are consumers really so stupid as to go for such a crock? Oy.Anyway....How many movies do you remember seeing back in a different lifetime that you thought were really cool only to check 'em out in the current day and find that they really were average at best? The Sword and the Sorcerer is definitely one of those movies. 25 years is a long time, and my viewing of this film back in 1982 at age 20 was...let's just say...""enhanced"" by...well...the things I used to do prior to plopping myself in front of cable TV at 2 a.m.But The Sword and the Sorcerer is still fun. The audio magicians did a little sorcery of their own and gave Sword a surround sound update back in 2001, but the DVD picture is still as grainy as a VCR would be.The story is cool. A fictional Days of King Arthur-ish tale of Tyrant Titus Cromwell's rise to power, and, Son of King Richard, Prince Talon's fight to take back the throne that would have been his. Throw in evil Sorcerer Xusia (also vying for the Crown), have him conjure up a ton of camp and a lack of continuity, and you have what-seemed-a-lot-better-at-the-time The Sword and the Sorcerer.The Sword and the Sorcerer was Albert Pyun's directorial debut (and it shows). But the movie's $40MM box office take surprised even the producers that had originally planned a sequel called Tales of the Ancient Empire that continued the adventure of Prince Talon. Pyun said that Sword was so profitable that ironically a decision was made to scrap the sequel and just bank the profits of the original. Smart move.Pyun went on to direct a score of B movies and clunkers. The little known lead actors all went on to lead pretty successful TV careers. No sequel was ever made.

In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed named Stryker to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a ""cure"" is found that makes all mutants human.Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the ""cure"" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films (unless you're watching all of the movies in one sitting!). New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. Acting is 5-Stars. Movies are 5-stars.Then along comes X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This movie, while entertaining, didn't live up to the excellent standard set by the first 3 movies. It was cool to see Wolverine's origins and all, but I sure hope that they don't take the franchise down an origins path for all of the other X-men characters. I see on IMDB that there's already a plan for Wolverine Origins 2. I'm not excited. In fact I'm bummed that the plan isn't for another X-men movie as of today.If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) this set is a great opportunity to see the 3 original classic tales in chronological order and to own a kind of bonus movie.

We found this film and be very well done.  It's one fault it's credited by those who oppose it, is that it shows a side to President Obama that his faithful either can't tolerate or refuse to hear.  Further they don't want YOU to hear it!  So, now they are getting on here with their reviews (most of which if they were honest would have to admit they NEVER saw the film) and are nonetheless giving it a one star rating just to poison the effects of this documentary.  This film is a very courageous statement if you really consider who made it & produced it.Let me ask you a few questions and you will need to be open minded and fair.  Have you ever wondered why Obama's background (his political views and idealogy) weren't more vetted?  Have you ever questioned the source of your information?  Is it the mainline press on either CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, or ABC news?  I would venture that 85% of the top level broadcasters or news analysts, news writers, reporters, or news producers are either extreme left leaning or consider themselves Democrats.  Why does this even matter?  Because even the best of news people can't help but have their political bias show through... and the worst among them purposely slant and ignore important news stories that don't show their political ""Rock Stars"" in a good light.  If these channels had been more committed to unbiased news then there would never have been a Fox News.  The reason Fox News has now overtaken all the other news broadcasts in the rating is that they don't ignore the news stories that are breaking they report on them and follow the story to wherever it leads or investigate it to try to find out how or why it happened.  If you were college educated do you realize that 80% of the university professors are also clearly left leaning.  These institutions have even given entry and refuge to 60's radicals who clearly have agendas and actively plotted to overthrow our government.  Some of these very people have the President's ear and are his advisers.  Do you know that the President's election team in 2008 tried to buy his former pastor's silence?  It's because they knew if you heard, really heard what he believed you would be forced to think what was Obama thinking to stay in this man's church for all those years!Getting back to this film... clearly this IS a film that the people in Obama's reelection campaign do not want you to see.

As a psychological thriller there are none better.  As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.  And as a black comedy it's rivaled only by the 1989 cult classic Vampires Kiss, to which it bears a striking resemblence.  In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.Christian Bale, his name above the title for the first time in his career, stars as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who may or may not be a serial killer, depending on your point of view.  By that I mean, second time director Mary Harron (avoiding the sophomore slump) leaves the movie open to interruption.  And if you're looking for easy answers there aren't any here.  The euphoric tone in which the story unfolds seems to suggest, in retrospect, that the movie may actually be the elaborate fantasy of a very deranged individual.  Or maybe it's the setting, Reagan-era New York, that makes it seem so alien.  Either way it's a tremendously thought-provoking film that should have people talking for a long time to come.Just imagine if Leonardo DiCaprio were in the lead?  It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.  But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!  It's not that Chris Bale looses himself in the character so much as Patrick Bateman has no character, and it's that understanding that he brings to the role.  He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.  And he does, which is most disturbing of all.  Not the blood or the gore, which is toned down from the book, but the fact that he fits in so well.  Maybe that's the most tellling statement of all, to say that society bears the responsibilty for having created the Patrick Bateman's of the world.His rampage begins by taking the life of a homeless man, to which he feels his financial status entitles him to.  He moves on to supposed &quot;productive&quot; members of society who, despite all their money, never seem to be doing much work.  It's then, after killing Paul Allen (Jared Leto), that he finds himself being questioned by a private investigator (Willem Dafoe), seemingly more interested in flirting with him than interrogating him.  I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.Especially interesting of that bunch is Cara Seymour in a performance so drop dead hysterical (excuse the in joke) that she'll have you laughing long after the movie's over.  She plays Christie, a street walker who falls victim to Bateman's most violent fantasy.  This is one of those tongue-in-cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.Of course, I don't mean to suggest this for everybody, because as most of the best films usually are, it's of an acquired taste.  Anyone not willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise should be advised to stay away.  Especially when you consider you're being asked to invest in a protagonist who has essentially no redeeming qualities except for the fact that he's potrayed by an actor of immeasurable talent, Christian Bale, whose sure to win over more fans (known as Baleheads) with this star-making performance.So for those of you with no qualms over endearing yourself to a really bad guy, you're in for a smart, scary thriller that's one of the most chilling of this or any other year.",0.7142857142857143,2,21,3,108,1,1,3660,627,1,0.12961496498081865,0.08333333333333333,67.18,34.59,0.0012816283652859661,0.001284874535764281,0.04356914922935684,0.601288319199774,0.35257602866981885,0.005737704918032787,0.0001951067233776876,1,,0.0,0.625,1.4285714285714286,2.6666666666666665,long,

As with others who have written reviews, this is one of my favorite shows, and I am a nonrepentent Lloyd Webber fan.The film changes the story around a bit from the stage production, and I think it may have taken some of the mystery away from the ""Angel of Music"" and the Phantom himself.  The stage productions I have seen present the lagoon scene much later in the story, and it keeps the Phantom as a shadowy figure whom even Christine doesn't really know and has never really seen.  I also think the Phantom is much more accessible in this film than in the stage version.  In the film, he is sighted many times by people right on the stage rather than being the subject of a ""ghost story"" until his love for Christine makes him come forward as in the stage versions.  One wonders if the film Phantom wouldn't have been sharing lunch with the crew considering how accessible he is.  Also, one of the other reviews shown here states that the Phantom is made too sympathetic.  This is true, but I think he loses that sympathy when he speaks from Christine's father's crypt making her think that it is her father recommending that she go with him rather than with Raoul.The film cast is very good.  Messrs Butler and Wilson, and Ms. Rossum are all excellent actors and show it.  I'm glad Ms. Rossum has finally been discovered.  I saw her first in ""Songbird"", and I think she is finally blossoming into a beautiful and talented young woman with a lovely voice.  Simon Callow gaves his usual wonderful performance and the ""over the top"" performance of Minnie Driver as the Prima Donna is wonderful.  She deserves the supporting actress nominations she won from several organizations.All in all, this is a film which should be owned and watched over and over just as I listen to my cast recording.  Gerard Butler does not sing as well as Michael Crawford or other actors who played the Phantom in other productions I have seen on stage.  His voice was stretched several times.  However, both Mr Crawford and Ms. Brightman, as talented as they are, are getting a little beyond the age where they could play these parts on screen.  The only regret I have is that with all the production scope of films, one misses sitting in the audience after the lagoon scene on stage wondering ""how did they do that"".",0.6666666666666666,1,24,5,53,0,0,2406,428,1,0.29206065759637184,0.85,69.52,83.32,0.1449106407214949,0.2715133555775454,0.0018292411655810722,0.579906571173872,0.001840191361506656,0.00997506234413965,0.00027696994876055944,1,,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,4.333333333333333,long,

So get your copy today!UPDATES: There's questions as to whether or not F13 and JGTH will be unrated. Well, extras were revealed today (6/28). I read them and while they say R-Rated Theatrical Version for both titles, the specs for F13 '80 is identical to the original Blu release and JGTH features the commentary which on the DVD, was for the Unrated Version only. So if anything it's possible we are getting the Unrated cuts for those 2. For those who think we're getting only the Theatrical Cuts of those 2 films, let me remind you NOTHING IS FINAL. But I say with all confidence that it's again possible we ARE getting the Unrated Versions of those 2 films. I will point out though that all other films WILL be their original R-Rated Theatrical Versions (however, F13 '09 will have both Rated and Unrated cuts seeing is how the disc in the set is the same as previously released).UPDATE 9/4/13: A Blu-ray.com forum member got the set early and confirmed that F13 '80 is Uncut but unfortunately JGTH is the R-Rated Theatrical Version.

Those of us who remember such early efforts as BANANAS or TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN--which we loved but no one was about to try and pass off as great cinema--also remember when almost out of the blue, Allen became a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  LOVE AND DEATH was sharp, literate and suggested that could put together a well crafted film.  But ANNIE HALL caused genuine excitement, garnered deserved critical acclaim and (although Allen purportedly could not have cared less) Academy Award nominations.  It seemed, at the time, a quantum leap in terms of sophistication.  It also hinted at artistic problems that would start to surface in later films.One of the key differences between ANNIE and the earlier comedies was the lightly self-referential touch.  If Allen had always played a nebbishy everyman in his early comedies: he now played--truer to his actual life experience certainly--a nebbishy successful filmmaker and comedian.  The change was crucial.  He was no longer a little man. Alvy Singer may have been a neurotic mess, but, like Woody Allen, he was a real player.By the time we get to EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU some 20 years later, Allen's milieu is clearly defined--and extended.  The single and childless Alvy and Annie have been replaced by the multi-married, no longer together Joe and Steffi (Goldie Hawn)  and their array of children from their various marriages, blended, by all appearances, more or less successfully.  Like so many of Allen's later films, it takes place in a glowing, warm upper middle class Manhattan (when we're not off to Paris or Venice).  It's a world most of us can only dream of  (as was true of the young and struggling Woody Allen once).If EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU's setting is a kind of fantasyland, its characters are probably equally fantastic.  Sophisticated, sweetly neurotic, but hardly desperate, these are people who remain best friends with former spouses, with no lingering &quot;issues&quot; rearing their heads at odd moments.  College aged children play cupid for their own parents, and go, with a  nod and a wicked wink, way beyond innocent PARENT TRAP territory.  But nothing is done maliciously.  Intentions are sort of good even when they involve such unethical behavior as eavesdropping on a private therapy session.As warm and engaging as the characters are, and as attractive as their world seems, placing it all in the context of an old-style &quot;burst into song&quot; kind of musical belies all that.  If the similar milieu of  HANNAH AND HER SISTERS seemed like a possibility (a real world that we're just not fortunate enough to inhabit), this film's setting is pure fantasy.  It is tempting to say that in his post-Mia period, Allen is projecting a vision of the kind of social world where forgiveness and reconciliation are not only possible, but are a virtual given.It's probably not wise to rely on a psycho-analytic approach to Woody Allen's films.  It's hard to ignore the fact though that both in real life and in his films, Allen went from dyed-in-the-wool bachelorhood to having an extended, perhaps eccentric family situation.  It cannot be surprising that themes of family and forgiveness should appear in his later films.  What's fascinating here is that these themes are addressed in a normally light-entertainment mode (musical comedy).  It makes the yearning for innocence all the more profound in a way.The music is pretty good too.  Yes, the untrained voices of the actors work only in the context of the movie and no one's going to rush out looking for the soundtrack, but in that context, the device does work fairly well.  Call it a little &quot;alienation effect&quot; or an &quot;Allen-ation&quot; effect.  I find the songs effective for the most part, and certainly no more disturbing than some of the more traditional bits of surrealism in Woody Allen films (e.g. Marshall McLuhan jumping out from behind a movie display board in ANNIE HALL to lecture some pretentious buffoon about the real significance of his work).  ANNIE was a great film, EVERYONE SAYS isn't quite on that level.  But in the overall context of his work, it's certainly merits our attention--and our affection.",1.0,0,27,4,142,0,0,4272,706,1,0.19887088856161023,0.0,59.43,33.58,0.057197480266801735,0.027089864457654045,0.11726490312781955,0.7973161345330498,0.0011316176146749228,0.006320224719101123,0.0002340276152586005,3,3.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,,long,

Thus, if you're against the War in Iraq, for example, you're unpatriotic or anti-soldier.  If you're for it, you're some sort of imperialist or pawn of the robberbarons.  Can anything in life be so neatly divided?  Ironically, I was reminded of this schism while watching ""The Green Berets.""  On one hand, the film correctly celebrates the bravery and dedication of American soldiers during an era in which many men--including my own father--and women served honorably in our armed forces, even if some, as is always the case with any military throughout history, clearly did not.  On the other hand, it's almost pathological determination to sell the Viet Nam War while using cheap dramatic constructs and generally childish assumptions marks it as propaganda of the clumsiest kind.  What then to make of it?  Well, if you're a John Wayne fan--which I am--the Duke turns in a reasonably enjoyable performance, on par with his solid presence in such classics as ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" even if he seems too old and out-of-shape for the character he plays.  Co-stars Jim Hutton, David Jansen, and George Takei, along with many of Wayne's frequent supporting players, are quite capable, and the production itself--aside from some dicey model work with a helicopter--has a Hollywood gloss.  The script and direction (for which Wayne shares some of the responsibility), on the other hand, often come up short.  An attack on a base camp, for instance, is suitably dramatic, but soon after the battle is lost at great expense by the Green Berets and South Vietnamese civilians, a short strafing run eliminates the enemy, leaving viewers to wonder if a tactical evacuation of the camp without the costly battle might have been a wiser course of action in the first place.  The script also is compelled to introduce one tragedy after another, most of which focus on the plight of a young Vietnamese boy (even if his name and others are typical Hollywood gibberish for Asian terms and nomenclature).  ""Ham Chuk's"" home, belongings, parents, dog, and American surrogate father all fall victim to the war, leaving viewers to scratch their heads when the Wayne character reassures the boy at the end that the Americans are there to help people like him--just how much more help of this kind can the poor kid take?  Even the actual combat scenes, while sometimes gruesome for the day, seem rather juvenile, as the film takes a laughably cowboys-and-Indians approach to many scenes.  If watched as a pseudo-western with stock characters and fantasy ideas about real life, ""The Green Berets"" is palatable; if viewed as actual commentary about the war, it's a lot harder to take.",0.4117647058823529,10,37,8,97,3,0,2822,471,1,0.02336601307189543,-0.1,50.09,88.74,0.001681586016337175,0.0017201346491960074,0.0016925602064902017,0.9932078229220703,0.0016978962059061807,0.013111268603827072,0.00014586068221124793,2,2.0,0.0,0.3888888888888889,4.117647058823529,3.6666666666666665,long,

That's not to say it isn't a hundred per cent worth owning. Its nearest antecedent is Roeg's 'Bad Timing', although lacking his discipline. It is a kick in the pants to the corporate blandness of Hollywood thrillers with their identical plinking piano. Made by a Brit, class conflict is an inevitable theme as a married couple, both from the wrong side of the tracks, discover that a hitherto unspoken and possibly unrealised part of their alliance, their jaundiced view of rich women, will unexpectedly tear them apart.Unfortunately, the plot is also boneheaded. For instance, the killer knocking out his victim by picking her up, turning her upsidedown and hitting her head on the bathroom carpet. Er, right. Slamming her head against the wall I'd believe. Also, a man is shot between the eyes with a humungous machine gun for half a minute without letting go of the machine-gunner's foot. The deus ex machina final re-appearance of Mike Desantos and the explanation given instantly kills your belief in the story.

I remember seeing this WAYYYYY back whenever there would be those old Creature Features on Sunday afternoons at 4:00 and you were a kid in a candy store. I had nothing to do but watch horror movies all afternoon long and just eat junk-food. I missed that show. The thing was that I had remembered a few scenes and I knew it was about rats but I just couldn't find the movie. Now by the power of God (Satan? Must be to re-release THIS movie) Anchor Bay re-released this in the Uncut version. This movie is just funny as hell. The movie soundtrack by Goblin is another addition to you who love Eurohorror, the special effects are low and cheesy, and the rats themselves are actually pet mice painted black!!! PURE GENIUS!!!

Like the road to Hell, I'm sure director Cox had very good intentions when he got together with many of his friends in a small Mexican ghost town (actually Spain) and just let the camera roll while everyone improvised. Given all of the peronas involved (including many legends from the early 1980s punk scene and independent filmmakers) you would expect something at least slightly interesting to occur. Unfortunately, the result is just directionless and meandering. Whereas films like Repo Man are iconoclastic and make interesting comments about the disintegration of society, this is just a mess about a bunch of adults acting silly. It may have been fun to film, but it is a chore to sit through.I wonder if Cox truly felt he had created a worthwhile movie, or if he just tried to salvage whatever he could from the footage he shot after going to the expense. Whatever the case, this disaster bascially ended Alex Cox's career by making it impossible for him to find any further financial backing (he only made one more cheap film in Mexico). Talk about going out with a whimper.For those who care, this is Courtney Love's first film, from before she became famous through marriage.

You will see a mix of Broadway, dance, melody, showtunes, film, burlesque, discotheque, television, comedy and satire in this one-time only concert from 1972.Liza made history because this is the very first concert of its kind (like they say, like mother, like daughter). But it's not just a concert. Nope. Watching ""Liza with a 'Z'"" is like going to the theater or the circus or wherever you go to get your kicks and seeing everything come to life, all of a sudden right in front of you. This concert reminds me of an intricate play because Liza is so inventive and dramatic and over-the-top.The woman never stops singing and dancing. She actually keeps dancing and trancing and prancing with her hands and body parts in all different directions while the curtain is going up and down. That's so '70s! It's like watching a home-video inside Studio 54. And every single performance is just as nice as the one before it. Liza was perfect because the writers and choreographers and directors and producers all came together to put on the show of their collaborative lifetimes.The concert is a total of 54 minutes in length and includes these songs/performances:Yes, God Bless The Child, Liza with a Z, It Was a Good Time, I Gotcha, Son of a Preacher Man, Ring Them Bells, Bye Blackbird, You've Let Yourself Go, My Mammy, Cabaret Medley & included on the bonuses (not part of the original segmented concert) is the performance for Mein Herr.Like I said the concert, from beginning to end is a non-stop musical party. Liza is one big dancing queen. I especially love when Liza comes out in that skintight red Halston super-short dress. What a hot mama!The DVD has so many extras on it as well. Besides commentary from Liza (that can be played over the concert) as well as a detailed summary of Liza's career (as well as the others who helped produce this) this DVD includes these bonus features:Toronto Film Festival interview (with Liza and some of the other people who helped make this DVD possible)-38 minsClips of Liza with John Kander-12 minsA&E; Liza Biography-85 minsGLAAD Award and Performance-10 minsEven after seeing this DVD a billion times it still feels like I just saw it for the first time because Liza puts on a unique show that will bring you along with her on that musical journey of song. ""Liza with a 'Z'"" is just too much because like the star of the show it is so bubbly and full of spirit. But on the other hand Liza still leaves us wanting more. And isn't that the ultimate goal of any performer?",1.0,0,66,15,90,1,2,2580,454,1,0.23930905695611576,0.0,67.49,90.09,0.6823286365592953,0.001588488189128855,0.001589878446078389,0.2630686963762111,0.05142430042928645,0.02558139534883721,0.0003874467260751647,1,,0.0,0.5,0.0,,long,

Frank Butler, the best shot in the country, sings. [The attitudes then are somewhat different today.] A shot announces the entrance of Annie Oakley, who is rough and ready. She uses a rifle instead of a shotgun to keep lead out of the meat. [Annie's song is still funny after sixty years.] The songs tell the story, like some opera. You won't hear them on radio today. ""What's so funny?"" Can a little lady beat a man? [This is almost like a cartoon.] Annie is a sure shot and can match Frank Butler until he missed. ""It was easy as pie."" She is offered a job in entertainment. Is pleasing an audience a thrill? They travel through the Midwest. The Indians travel to another car. A stampede for supper.Jake gets a reading lesson from Annie. People notice Annie now. Annie and Frank talk on the vestibule of the railroad car. Business is off, they have competition. [No mention of the economy.] Can a new trick bring in new business? Chief Sitting Bull knows better than to invest in show business. Annie gets top billing this week. A novelty act? Indians chase a covered wagon. We see trick riders. Annie rides in standing on her horse, shooting at many targets, and doing trick riding too. [A stunt double is used except for close-ups.] Annie is adopted by Chief Sitting Bull in a ceremony. [This dance pads out the movie.] ""Am I an Indian yet?"" The show travels to Europe to perform before their crowned rulers. Annie saves the Deadwood Coach. But the show isn't financially successful. They return on a cattle boat! A big show has big costs.Back in the states Pawnee Bill considers merging with Buffalo Bill. Both shows are deep in debt. Annie puts up her money. She's happy with what she's got. [A poor example to others?] Frank and Annie meet happily, but argue. This leads to another song. ""Yes, I can."" The shooting contest doesn't go as well as expected, until Frank evens the contest. Annie concedes the match. There is a happy ending for them.This is an interesting story that is seldom shown on broadcast TV because of its subject matter. Could they make such a movie today? No, for technical reasons: where will they find that many horses and experienced riders in Hollywood? Or the audience for western movies? Does most people's idea of western history come from show business entertainment? You will learn more from a history book about the late 19th century. Traveling carnivals used to feature shooting galleries for entertainment until the 1968 Gun Control Act was passed.

But with a Multi Disk Player, there's Alot Less wear & Tear on the machine when it comes to the Opening & Closing, which means it will Last Longer; and by lasting longer, it means LESS Money being Spent to Replace that machine, which means more money in the Consumer's Pocket for Spending on things that Need to be Spent on; For EXAMPLE:  Life Insurance, Medical Insurance, Auto & OR Home Insurance, Clothes, Food, Electric Bill's, Cable & OR Telephone Bill's, Repairs & Maintenance for the Home Steed and or for a individual's Own Vehicle, Laundry & Laundry Supplies, and so on.  These are just a few of the things that people Require / Need Money for.

Forget renting it, find yourself a copy to own.This movie, at least as far as I am concerned, is Robert Zemeckis' best, even better than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.  Let me begin by stating that if your IQ is lower than 100 (or 120 for that matter), you probably won't enjoy it.  Why?  There are indeed no ""aliens"" or ""monsters"" that jump out of the shadows, nor are there big men with big guns that blow them up and cheer ""go back to your home planet, you scum...America rules!!!""  This isn't Star Trek, nor is it your typical cornball ""sci-fi"" flick.  If it were, I wouldn't be reviewing it, because I wouldn't have seen it.  What this movie is is an amazing rendition of one of Carl Sagan's most enthralling and intelligent novels, and it is indeed a fine example of just how good a film based on a work of fiction can be.  What this piece is is a work of art; rather than stimulate our animalistic urges to see ""little green men"" pop out at us with ""plasma rifles,"" like most everything else that's come out of Hollywood since its inception, the ending of the film leaves it up to our imaginations, essentially, to decipher precisely what happened to Ellie (Dr. Elanaor Arroway, the protagonist) during her journey to the galaxy in which the star Vega is contained.  The beginning of this film alone, in which a three-plus minute digression from our planet through seemingly trillions of miles of the universe takes place, was enough to hook me.  This film is about not only the endless debate between religion and science, of which Ellie is a firm believer in the latter, but it is about her transformation, more or less, in the end of the film to someone just a little less skeptical...what Zemeckis (and obviously Sagan) was indeed trying to portray in the ending of this film is that there is reason to have ""faith"" in the future, even in these desolate times, and to show us that there just might be more than meets the eye to our existence...and that there may be more than we know, and/or are capable of knowing, to ourselves, our race, and each other and what each of us believes, especially in the face of having no tangible ""proof""...and finally that we are indeed never as ""alone"" as we all feel at one time or another.  A truly unique and masterful film, consistently underrated and panned by critics, most often for its inclusion of a certain ex-president in a couple video clips...give me a break.  Does that really detract from the quality and purpose of the film?  I think not, and to give the film lower marks for it is ludicrous, in my opinion.I am not a religious individual, and am in fact an agnostic.  I could easily envision overtly religious people loathing Jodie's character beginning with the scene of the death of her father, as she hastily denies the support of the religious figure(s) at her father's wake.  However, like I said earlier, the film is by no means out to deny the existence of God or debunk any religion, nor does it attempt to verify these concepts.  It is merely contrasting the two sides of the argument and makes valid points in favor of each.  So, my main point is that this film is so much more than a ""sci-fi"" film (to say that this film doesn't compare to Star Wars or Star Trek is quite absurd; they aren't even honestly in the same genre in the first place, and this film transcends any of that...stuff).  Just give it a chance, and if you disagree, so be it...but I know that it moved me like no other film had in quite some time, and I'm a better person for having seen it, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films, even eight years after its release.

The first disc is given over mostly to food, with ready-to-eat breakfast cereals probably the biggest category (interspersed with other highly advertised foods like white bread and canned soup).  Sugar and white bleached flour were indeed pushed to the hilt!The only real problem is that when the commercials shift to color (and they are interspersed with the B&W;), the color is almost always astonishingly garish and distorted.  Did anyone even look at the DVD transfer, even if there was no computer correction?  Ads from the late 60s/early70s glow and forms violate their boundaries beyond the wildest imagination of that era's hippies.  And unlike back then, most of today's TV's will not allow the viewer to dial down the color ""intensity.""In our case, we often remembered the jingles, so the color-monsters didn't get us down.

(3.5 Stars),"""The Oh in Ohio"" is a self-assured slice of life that can touch viewers while disconcerting them all the while. Its comedic aspirations don't come to full fruition and its screenplay is a tad undercooked, but the actors overcome this with suave, easy charm.Poking sly, understated fun at the overemphasis of sex in society, it is neither for the prudish nor for those who need slapstick to find humor. Sex may be the centrifugal force of the film, but this is no ""40-Year Old Virgin,"" even though Paul Rudd plays similarly sympathetic characters in each.Priscilla Chase, played by Parker Posey, is an ambitious, ditzy woman on the fast track to large-scale corporate success. However, to the dismay of her schoolteacher husband Jack, played by Rudd, she is the consummate cold fish. She may know the exact number of times they've had sex, but she has never had a single orgasm - ever - due to a ""sexual dysfunction."" Nor does she seem interested in doing so soon.Things go up in smoke. She may have caused the problem, but Jack cannot get past the fact that the one woman he has not satisfied in bed is his wife of ten years. After moving to the garage and confiding in his friend and colleague Popovitch, played with cheeky delight by Keith David, he finally begins a full-fledged separation from Priscilla when she becomes overly addicted to a vaginal vibrator. He moves to the Manly Arms apartment complex - ""Why settle for the mundane when you can be the king of your domain?"" - and gives in to the advances of sophisticated 18-year old student Kristen, played perfectly by Mischa Barton, who lost her innocence long before he came along.Priscilla is thus left to find her sexual identity. She pursues sex with random men, but she finds it unsatisfying. Sex with sex shop clerk Justine, played by Heather Graham, doesn't do the trick either. Wayne the Pool Guy, played with zest and warmth by Danny DeVito, however, puts an entirely new spin on things, awakening ""parts of Cleveland"" she never knew existed. In Wayne she findsLiza Minelli is a hoot in her scene as an overzealous sex therapist, and Posey really brings it home when Jack finally gives Priscilla the satisfaction that was missing from their bedroom by merely calling her  cell phone during, of all moments, an important board meeting. It's where the phone specifically is, of course, that matters.""The Oh In Ohio"" is equal parts raunchy and touching as it cloaks its characters in genuine humanity. Sex may come between them, but it's who they are, not what they are, that matters in the end.",1.0,0,36,7,80,1,0,2561,444,1,0.11723418857565202,0.0,67.08,106.67,0.0018878180836211633,0.001890012183618863,0.0018832326594828337,0.9924288199024928,0.0019101171707843168,0.014057008980866849,0.00039032006245121,1,,0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.0,,long,

Disney extended an invitation to all the BlogHer attendees to a screening at the historic Reading Gaslamp Theater on 5th Avenue in San Diego. The theater was packed with conference goers and Disney even treated us all to FREE popcorn and soft drinks.In ""The Help,"" Emma Stone plays Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, a young woman who is just returning to 1960's Jackson, Mississippi after completing four years of college. In her absence, all her childhood friends have married, had kids and are now living a modern day version of their parents lives, including having underpaid African American maids come in to their houses to cook, clean and raise their kids. Skeeter wants more than to just play bridge with her friends and climb the social ladder. She wants to be writer. So she gets a job at the local paper writing about the only thing that a woman in the 1960's South is allowed to write about: household cleaning.Skeeter's best friend Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) has became the controlling town socialite who keeps all the young wives in line by intimidating them if they fail to follow her lead. After Skeeter learns that her family's maid was fired by her mother after over 20 years of faithful service, she decides to write a book based on the point of view of the black maids in Jackson who daily leave their own homes and children to go and cook, clean and the raise kids in other homes where they are not even allowed to use the bathroom.Skeeter's plans are complicated by the fact what she plans to do is considered illegal under Mississippi law and because Hilly is the town bigot who is pressuring everyone to build separate bathroom facilities for the maids because she believes that blacks and whites cannot even share the same bathrooms in the privacy of their own homes.Skeeter is friends with Elizabeth Leefolt (played by Ahna O'Reilly) and Skeeter talks Elizabeth's maid, Aibileen Clark into telling her story for the book.  Viola Davis gives the most wonderful performance of the movie as Aibileen, a maid who has lost her own son due to bigotry and is currently struggling with turning a blind eye to how Elizabeth treats her 3 year old daughter who Elizabeth considers to be ugly and therefore does not deserve any of her time or effort.The movie follows how Skeeter finds out what the maids are really thinking and how woman, no matter the color of skin or the amount of money, are struggling with finding their way in a male dominated southern society.This is a wonderful, complex movie that shines a light on the difficult way of life for most blacks in the 1960's south.  It is obvious in the movie that most people in town are not bigots like Hilly, but they are so afraid of losing their place in society, that they go along with keeping the status quo and treating their help just a little better than slaves.  The movie also shows the struggle of women in the 1960's who want to be more than housewives and mothers.I predict were will be lots of Oscar nominations for this film.  Actress great Cicely Tyson had a small, but moving part in this film that had everyone crying in the audience as the Phelan maid who is fired after 20 years of service just to save face at a society dinner party.Actress Sissy Spacek was laugh-out-loud funny as Hilly's aging mother who is suffering from early Alzheimer's.  I think that actress Allison Janney who played Skeeter's mother will get an Oscar for her performance as a woman dieing of cancer and struggling with doing what she knows is right, even if it means losing all her society friends.  And also actress Octavia Spencer, was wonderful as Minny Jackson, the maid that first worked for the biggest bigot in town and then for the socialite from the wrong side of the tracks while also struggling with domestic violence in her own home.This is a wonderful movie that everyone will enjoy. It is rated PG-13 due to implied off screen violence, language and adult themes.",0.6666666666666666,2,41,8,71,0,0,4097,719,1,0.15922174840085287,0.2857142857142857,57.95,114.12,0.0011356729894784069,0.20243455974207147,0.001127172698016229,0.794167052551953,0.0011355420184807675,0.010007322431047107,0.00016268098259313485,1,,0.0,0.5714285714285714,1.3333333333333333,4.666666666666667,long,

I must say that of the Blu-ray's I own, I have been most impressed with several of Warner Brothers' - they seem to do a better job in dealing with their older movies than many other studios are.  They obviously put effort into producing a great Blu-ray transfer and total package for this movie.  Even the booklet that they included was well put together and genuinely interesting to look through.  This is one of the few movies I was actually kind of hoping to view some deleted scenes of, but these aren't to be found - alas, you can't have it all I guess.  Kudos to Warner Brothers for a fine Blu-ray release!Note: My star rating is purely on the Blu-ray quality and not the film itself.

Carpenters Halloween, Pyscho, Friday The 13Th, and George A. Romeros Dead Series. This (next to Night Of The Living Dead, which cant be beaten) is the best zombie movie of all time. Writer/Director George A. Romero does an exelent job of creating a realistic, chilling zombie masterpiece. Other zombie movies pale in comparison to this one. This is fun to watch, and you feel like you become part of the story. The movie takes place after the dead have taken over earth (meaning this takes place pretty soon after NOTLD) and it is crazy. A team of 4 people manage to escape the zombies in a helecopter. They eventually find a shopping mall to stay in which they think is safe... or is it? This movie is chilling and the gore is great. They just dont make em' like this anymore. Hats off to Mr. Romero for this astonishing piece of horror art. You must see this movie if you havnt. You will not regret it.

At the very beginning of the film, when Sanjuro tells the nine the coast is clear, they pop out of the floorboards looking for all the world like a group of Japanese prairie dogs.The other scene is at the end, during the final confrontation between Sanjuro and Muroto.  It's gory in a most entertaining fashion, and worthy of several rewinds.I enjoyed the, well, I wouldn't call it exactly sexual, tension between Sanjuro and the chamberlain's wife and daughter.  Maybe it doesn't work out that way in Japanese, but in the English subtitles, there are some definite sexual undertones to the whole &quot;sheathed sword&quot; speech.The sub-titling is well-done, and none of the background speech goes untranslated, aside from one or two vocalisations of &quot;hai.&quot;  My limited Japanese skills sufficed quite well.I will be watching more of Kurosawa's films.",0.6666666666666666,1,53,7,46,0,0,1158,188,1,0.11293073593073594,0.4,62.58,22.07,0.003945700038335122,0.003936921403116812,0.35216434513596023,0.4736501153966439,0.1663029180259439,0.045768566493955096,0.0005752085130859936,1,,0.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,,long,

The movie had a good flow - one of my pet peeves is when a film goes overboard on the schtick, or on the development of one character over all else, etc. This film had good balance. I have always kind of liked Rutger Hauer, but I like him better after what is almost a cameo (very brief). George Clooney's character was understated but very appropriate - same for Julia Roberts. If you like Drew Barrymore in some films but not others, you would like her in this one. My wife dislikes most of what I watch (action & adventure, righteous revenge, medieval, etc.). Not from the U.S., she too was engaged with the drama and story. Not a ramped-up foreign espionage film but a character study with some of that in it.

This 89-minute long, black and white 1932 classic is a sweet, infectious, romantic musical comedy featuring Great American Songbook music by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.  It  stars the ever charming French crooner Maurice Chevalier as Maurice Courtelin, a Parisian tailor who is owed a great deal of money  by the titled but penniless French nobleman, Vicomte Gilbert de Vareze (Charles Ruggles).  While he hopes to scratch up some money somewhere, Vareze moves the tailor into the family chateau and introduces him as a baron.  Soon the entire aristocratic household is enchanted by him, except for haughty Princess Jeanette (Jeanette MacDonald).  The script was written by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young, based upon a play by Leopold Marchand and Paul Armont.Considering its age, its origins, and its wealth of talent before and behind the camera, a viewer might expect that it was directed by Mamoulian's colleague, the uber-talented German refugee Ernst Lubitsch, but it was not.  It was directed and produced by Rouben Mamoulian, ( APPLAUSE,Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (1932)with Fredric March), an experienced Broadway and Hollywood director of musicals, a man with a lot of technological talent: he even did the film editing.  Well, Lubitsch was known for his witty scripts; Mamoulian wasn't necessarily.  But nevertheless this script is witty, and risqu&eacute;; it's a real shame that it's not subtitled in this only recently released DVD.The film is set in and around Paris, France, at roughly the time of its making.  It was the third of four co-starrings of Chevalier(Gigi), and MacDonald(Rose Marie), following on LOVE PARADE  and ONE HOUR WITH YOU.  Chevalier was his usual effortlessly effervescently charming self; MacDonald was stiff, but not quite as stiff as she would become, and in fine voice.  They were supported by several comic stalwarts.  The Charleses: Ruggles,Goodbye Love (1933), as the Viscount de Vareze, debtor; and Butterworth,Swing High, Swing Low, as the Count de Savignac, aged suitor of the princess, who has fallen on his flute.  C. Aubrey Smith,The Four Feathers, as the paterfamilias, the Duke d'Artelines. Bert Roach as Emile, Courtelin's friend.  Robert Greig as the butler Flammond: did they ever again make a comic film with a butler after he passed?  Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Armand de Fontinac.  Elizabeth Patterson as the first aunt, Ethel Griffies as the second, and Blanche Friderici as the third; a trio who calmed the three witches of Shakespeare in his famous Scottish play. A youngish Gabby Hayes has a bit, uncredited one-line part as the grocer in the opening montage.The picture introduced a remarkably beautiful young Myrna Loy,Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, fresh from her early years of playing mysterious Oriental ladies, two years before the Thin Man series.  She plays Countess Valentine, a man-chasing gal who goes for anything in pants, and even gets some of the movie's most witty lines.  In a scene where the Princess Jeanette becomes ill, and a doctor is required, her and Jeanette's mutual cousin de Vareze asks Valentine ""Could you go for a doctor?"" She replies, ""Certainly, bring him right in.""  Dr, de Fontinac will diagnose Jeanette's illness as, ""A peach must be eaten, a drum must be beaten, and a woman needs something like that.""The great Edith Head did the women's gowns.  The Internet Movie Database quotes Loy's autobiography as saying she was originally to wear the white empire-style dress for the party sequence, but Jeanette MacDonald was jealous of how she looked and insisted that she herself would wear it.  Loy surrendered the dress, but then went down to the costume room and, with a friend's help, put together the black lace outfit she wears in the final film. She stole the scene.  The 1932 film was made before the enforcement of Hollywood's repressive, censorious Hays Production Code.  In its post code reissue, Loy's part in the ""Mimi"" reprise was deleted: her negligee was deemed too revealing.  The motion picture was trimmed down to 96 minutes.  Those missing minutes have never been restored and are considered lost:  a further seven minutes has since been lost.This is a classic poor boy rich girl romantic musical comedy, such as we might expect from Mamoulian's colleague Lubitsch.  Mamoulian didn't quite have the Lubitsch touch, of course, but he combined his musical romance with advanced technology for the time, and plenty of style: he may even have handled its distinguished music more adeptly than Lubitsch could.  At any rate, his film feels modern today.  The opening montage, of Paris and Chevalier rhythmically awakening, is simply marvelous, and looks like a series of Eugene Atget photos come to life.  Chevalier's strut down busy streets might easily have helped inspire John Travolta's famous strut down Brooklyn's 86th Street in SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. Yet the earlier sequence was filmed on Paramount's back lot.And then there's the music.  Rogers and Hart, (BABES IN ARMS, PAL JOEY) were here inventing the modern movie musical.  Their songs are so well-integrated into the movie because they were written first: then the script was written around them.  We get the title song and the even more popular ""Isn't It Romantic."" ""Lover,"" and the wonderful ""Mimi"" sequence; ""Mimi"" was to be Chevalier's life-long signature song.  The picture opens with the promise that ""Once upon a time there was a princess and a prince charming, who was not a prince, but who WAS charming,"" and so, surely, is the picture.  Charming, and then some.",1.0,0,42,7,214,2,0,5600,906,1,0.19339387988872525,0.03541666666666666,70.43,64.37,0.2473332895596231,0.05300850944201501,0.0010067880884569334,0.6976572579032969,0.00099415500660814,0.0075,0.00017853954650955185,2,4.0,0.1318464,0.5,0.0,,long,

Binder, as the husband, portrays what every man thinks his fantasy is, bringing another woman into bed and getting his wife to actually like it.

Hemingway over-dramatizes a bit by becoming more sex-crazed and obsessed for women to the point where she ruins an important business BBQ gathering at their home, which I though was REALLY off line...no matter how attracted I was to anyone, I would at least wait until business concluded before coming on to someone...that I thought was kind of unrealistic.

It was pretty neat that Sam Raimi brought the EXACT SAME characters as the first one such as JK Simmons, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, and also there was that small appearance of The Green Goblin at nearly the end of this movie. This is a good movie. And it's about where Peter Parker (Tobey MacGuire) has a few difficulties, first he got fired from his job at the Pizza Place for being late and he goes to college. He's late then too. But also he doesn't pay the rent as of his apartment. But the main part, Harry Osbourn (James Franco) takes him to meet his friend Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina). Also known as 'Dock Ock' or Doctor Octopus. Because Peter is writing a paper on Octavious. Then the next day, Harry takes Peter to see Dr. Octavious and his creation of the tentacles but there is a bad malfunction along the way that destroys Octavious' plans and makes Harry mad. He's even more mad when he sees Spider-Man after saving Harry's life. Then his wife Rosie gets killed after a piece of glass goes into her eyes. Now Octavious is thinking about the stuff that went wrong and if he's going to drown the destroying tentacles down the river, Octavious is going to have to go with the tentacles. So now, he decides to be a villian wrecking the city and being mean. But then later on, Peter goes to his friend Mary Jane's play but has to catch a couple of villians. This causes him to be a little late and the Snooty Usher (Bruce Campbell) doesn't let him in. And then MJ wants to go out with a new boyfriend who works for NASA, John. And then Harry still is mad about what happened with Octavious and the malfunction. And gets more mad at Peter and keeps on questioning him about Spider-Man. So Peter decides ""He's Spider-Man No More."" So he acts like a regular guy. But MJ still doesn't want to go out with Peter. And stuff comes worst after Octavious destroys half the city. And later on, after he asks Harry for more tritium, the most dangerous thing on earth that destroys stuff, Harry gives it to him under one condition. If Octavious brings Harry Spider-Man, he'll give Octavious all the tritium he wants. Next J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) feels sorry about taking Spider-Man away. So then Peter Parker returns as ""SPIDER MAN!"" And then Octavious and Parker fight on the subway. And all the people on the subway care for him and say ""It's good to have him back."" But after one punch from Octavious' tentacle, Otto takes Spider-Man to Harry. This is one of the moments from Spider-Man that we've all been waiting for. Harry reveals who's under the mask. And it showed PETER! I thought Harry was going to beat him up but Harry was surprised. And Harry tells Peter where Octavious is and now Spider-Man goes to save the city and capture Octavious and save MJ. Soon he says a little Phsycology to Octavious. And Octavious decides he should do the right thing. Drown the tentacles and himself. Then the next day, during the wedding of Mary Jane's MJ changes her mind and doesn't want to marry John.

Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless immediately comes to mind. Others, like Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, whose title literally means The Adventure, as well as Italian slang for a one night stand, are not necessarily bad, but still only interesting failures, and not worthy of their reputation. L'Avventura was the first in a trilogy of black and white widescreen films Antonioni would make about alienation and personal anomy. The making of such trilogies was the rage at the time in European cinema, and, to an extent, still is. The trilogy was rounded out by La Notte and L'Eclisse in the two following years. When L'Avventura was released in 1960, it was greeted with catcalls at its world premiere, but won a Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and film critics championed it around the world. A few years later, one poll of critics listed it as the third greatest film of all time, after Citizen Kane and Battleship Potemkin. It now comes nowhere near Top Twenty lists. Both L'Avventura and Breathless were part of a claimed European revolution in film, where symbolism came to its apogee, and also included Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8, and the rest of the French New Wave. The reality of the film lies somewhere between the extremes. L'Avventura is a film that attempts much, but, after its interesting first third, it totally unravels with bad characterization, and narrative anomy, which is the fault of its three screenwriters, Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, and Tonino Guerra.It follows a group of rich hedonists who are frolicking in the Mediterranean, off of Sicily, in the Aeolian Sea. The three main characters are Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), a playboy architect, his frigid and scheming fianc&eacute;e Anna (Lea Massari), and Anna's best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti), the archetypal gorgeous brunet and gorgeous blond. They sail to a deserted island, Lisca Bianca, and during the course of their adventure, Anna simply disappears. Before she does, we have seen that she does not love Sandro, is passive-aggressive towards Claudia, and generally disdainful of her life and all others in it. She solicits sex to fill her inner emptiness, and gets her jollies by playing her friends with false claims of a shark in the waters. Before the other characters realize Anna has disappeared, we see a small boast speed away from the island.... L'Avventura, despite its reputation for being innovative, fails for the exact same reasons that most less supposedly innovative films do- it has cardboard characters, does not follow through on an intriguing premise, throws in an unneeded romance that never convinces a viewer of its participants' sparks, goes on far too long, and is far too pretentious. On a more mundane level, I wish some of the money spent on the restoration could have been used to hire competent actors to dub the film into English. No DVD of quality should lack this feature. Film is a visual medium, and for a film which is supposedly so visual, this should be a must. If only this film's fans and apologists would actually take only what is seen onscreen, and not imbue the film with what they think is there, or feel was intended, then a more just and objective evaluation of this film as an interesting, but ultimately failed, attempt at something different, could be agreed upon.In short, in art, intent is meaningless, because if not, we'd have to believe that very recognition of Antonioni's intent to bore the viewer somehow obviates the natural reaction of boredom, and thus all dull films could claim that boredom was their actual intent, thus leaving them not open to criticism on those grounds. Fortunately, intent is meaningless, and in that way one can say that L'Avventura misses the mark as a work of art, and is nowhere near as good as its vast reputation. Whether or not it's an actually bad film may depend only upon how much you value style over content, or gorgeous Italian babes in bathing suits. There are worse things to have to ponder, eh?",0.4166666666666667,14,9,1,127,1,0,4151,696,1,0.09047011041393059,0.0,53.75,-47.99,0.11515343668547444,0.0013874204102423487,0.0013982694310015217,0.7350038558784205,0.14705701759486114,0.0021681522524692846,0.00010035324341682724,6,4.0,0.0,0.4,5.833333333333334,,long,

There are several reasons for this fact, and by making that statement I am not stating that Peckinpah's film is in any way a bad film. No. It's merely a good film that has been passed by later films, and lacks the depth Leone's film still does. Part of the reason is that Leone's film is far more stylized and revolutionary. No, that film is not nearly as violent as Peckinpah's, and it is the violence of The Wild Bunch (and occasionally claims of its mainstreaming slow motion cinematography mixed with quick cutting) that is usually the lynchpin to arguments for its revolutionary status, not its more straightforward and derivative storytelling; although the earlier Bonnie And Clyde, by director Arthur Penn, deserves more of the credit (or blame) for mainstreaming over the top and slow motion violence.Compare the openings of the two films. In Peckinpah's film there is the great opening montage where the heroes/villains are introduced, and then the action is frozen into a black and white image. We see children sadistically dropping scorpions on to red anthills, then setting the wee creatures ablaze. Then we see the heroes, dressed as good guy American soldiers become vicious killers as they rob a bank, then get in a shootout with bounty hunters during a Temperance March. Leone's film shows almost nothing happen for the same amount of time. We see a train station captured, and wait. This is visual poesy. Peckinpah's is prose, albeit with tweaks.Now consider the two leading men used as psychopathic killers. In Peckinpah's film it's William Holden, a second level leading man. But in Leone's film it's Henry Fonda- one of Hollywood's towering filmic giants of American decency. Leone's choice is far more fundamentally disturbing. Then there is the actual storylines of the films. For all the claims of upsetting the apple cart, Peckinpah's tale is punctuated with numerous poorly scripted scenes. There are numerous moments where the characters in the gang simply do not speak realistically, and where they force laughter, like at the end of a bad tv sitcom- there's the scene with the sauna, with the whores, the scene where Angel's villagers steal weapons from the gang, and others. Leone has no such moments, and although there is less actual violence in Leone's films, there is nothing within Peckinpah's film as primally shocking nor disconcerting as watching Fonda's character murder the whole McBain clan.... Despite its reputation, this overrated film gives no real insight into either the Old West nor the human condition, and certainly nothing new. Too much of it, especially in interior stage shots, and in some of the dialogue and forced laughter between the gang members, feels like refried Bonanza, or other banal tv Westerns of the era, whereas Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West was wholly original. Peckinpah's film is a good, but not great, film, even if it is an enjoyable diversion for an afternoon, and was certainly influential- just look at the final shot of Lyle Gorch at the machine gun and there is an almost identical pose struck by James Franciscus at the end of Beneath The Planet Of the Apes, released a year later. If one goes into this film fresh, it will be an enjoyable film, a cut above the simpleminded John Wayne tripe that dominated the silver screen for the three decades prior, but if one expects a true masterpiece, disappointment is bound to follow.

The sci-fi mechanism is handled with a minimum of fuss, and lets the character-driven story shine. I haven't seen any other analysis that touches on this point: I think ""The Butterfly Effect"", that a single small event has massive repurcusions downstream in time, is an extended metaphore for the latency effects of child abuse, which is the real (and terrible) event at the center of this film. Many reviewers complained about the unrelieved grimness of the events in the narrative, but it only goes to show that the Freudian ""return of the repressed"" repeats the grimness of the original event. Try as he may, the main character can't seem to stop (or block out) all the repurcussions of the original child abuse event. The metaphore is given filmic visual gravitas in the image of the ""perfect"" gabled house (the mailbox which perfectly models the house behind it) being blown apart violently, an unconscious acting out of violence by the kids who were damaged by the abusive father -- an image that says that families are blown apart by domestic sexual abuse, which says the ""address"" of the issue is the home where it starts. Looked at in this light, the narrative is cohesive and justified. An excellent film that is underrated in my opinion.",1.0,0,59,7,39,0,0,1323,227,1,0.15926807760141093,0.0,51.21,38.99,0.003416927329387642,0.003413460328564775,0.1155034920947953,0.6159723088026448,0.2616938114446076,0.044595616024187455,0.0007552870090634441,1,,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,5.0,long,

It seems like it's going to be really entertaining, but ends up a bit anti-climactic. Then you slap yourself in the face for wasting that little bit of time and money in your life. Then, a few years later, you find that Slinky again and say, ""Hey, let me give this another shot,"" but get the same result. Then a few years later...well, you get the picture.So it's been with films like Punch Drunk Love and Click. They were good tries, but something always seemed to go wrong. Click was a little too vanilla, and took itself too seriously. Punch Drunk Love was too hard to follow to complete the full extent of the comedy. And yet, I can't not watch these movies if they randomly come on, whether it be on television or someone's DVD player.So when I heard that Adam Sandler was giving it another try with Funny People, I was a bit excited. I thought, ""Finally, he's gonna dooo it!""Sorry.The previews showed the film to be a bit dark, but it was a Judd Apatow movie, complete with Seth Rogen and that fat guy from Superbad. This can't lose.And you know what? It didn't lose.The premise is relatively simple. Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood mega-star. Upon learning that he has a rare and lethal disease, he begins a journey of deterioration to vent about his misfortune, without actually telling anyone about it. This leads to some very dark and unfunny stand-up acts. Seth Rogen plays Ira Wright, a fledgling stand-up comic who does open mic nights and sleeps on the couch of the apartment that he shares with Jason Schwartzman, who broke into Hollywood with a sitcom everyone loves to hate, ""Yo Teach,"" and Jonah Hill, who is on a little higher tier in the comedy world than Ira.Simmons hires Ira as a joke writer and personal assistant, and takes the young comic into the world of celebridom, with all of its quirks. A ""bromance"" seems to ensue, except on the occasion that Simmons reminds Ira that he just works for him when he's getting really crabby.The story, for the most part, flows fairly well. Those of us not in the limelight are able to perceive what happens behind that bright light that star comedians shine in, for better or for worse. The dramatic intent of Simmons' illness is also very well done. It is because of this foil that we truly care about him and the people he cares about. When we see how lonely Simmons is due to a lack of real relationships with real people, it tugs at the heart-strings. We also see the back-drop of the stand-up comedy world, which helps you appreciate it a little bit more. Granted, it was no Punchline with Tom Hanks, but it was good enough.The problem seems to be the romantic involvement. In the movie, Simmons contacts his old flame Laura, played by Leslie Mann. This in itself is not the problem. It helps steer the drama. The problem is that it drags on way too long. This movie is almost 2-1/2 hours. About 20 minutes could have been cut from the climactic finale of the Simmons/Laura story to keep the audience from falling asleep. Yes, it was that bad. Not bad enough to ruin the movie as a whole, but it sure came close.I think the comedy of the movie suffered because of this drag. Yes, I did laugh at quite a few scenes, but I seemed to have forgotten that I had laughed at all. References to the ""Yo Teach"" sitcom and the visits to the doctor's office were some of the most memorable.",0.5,1,18,4,214,2,1,3786,661,1,0.06800925925925926,0.25,73.17,92.8,0.024841517349311244,0.032167933386959356,0.001180527117032131,0.3888476361772698,0.5529623859694274,0.004754358161648178,0.0001320306311064167,1,,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,,long,

Asif Iqbal, Ruhel Ahmed, and Shafiq Rasul had traveled to Pakistan for Asif's wedding. On a lark, the group foolishly took a trip to Afghanistan at the worst possible time: October 2001, when the United States invaded Afghanistan following the attacks of September 11. Caught in the bloody melee of bombings and Taliban resistance, the men ended up among Taliban fighters as they tried to return to Pakistan. The threesome were arrested by the Northern Alliance, which turned them over to the U.S. military. Initially relieved to be in U.S. custody, they soon found that the Americans were determined to find them guilty of being jihadists. And if evidence was lacking, their captors were willing to coerce confessions.The story is told through interviews with Asif, Ruhel, and Shafiq and through re-enactments of their experiences, where the men are played by actors. Michael Winterbottom directed this film, which initially struck me as not being as polished as his fiction films. But, upon reflection, the recreations of the bloodshed in Afghanistan and life for the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are fairly meticulous and expert. Winterbottom undoubtedly did not want to give the impression of polish or contrivance, but of immediacy and realism in depicting the ordeal these three men suffered.  The men were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay from January 2002 to March 2004, first at ""Camp X-Ray"" and then at ""Camp Delta"". I'm inclined to believe their accounts of their experiences there, as the descriptions are similar to those related by other former Guantanamo and ""black site"" detainees.The men were tortured, deprived of sleep, and, for months, not allowed to stand or walk more than 5 minutes per week. This is not news, though this film offers more detail of the treatment of detainees than I've read in print. The strategies and apparent motivations of the American interrogators might be more damning. Military officers charged with finding ""bad people"" and eliciting information are under a lot of pressure to produce results. So they pass even unlikely culprits up the chain of command, until the prisoners get to Guantanamo Bay, by which time it should be painfully obvious that they don't possess useful information. Asking the same question for 2 years is unlikely to produce a different answer. In a pitiful effort to find ""The Tipton Three"" guilty of something, the U.S. claimed to have photographs placing them at an Al Qaeda rally in Afghanistan in 2000, a time for which the men had easily verifiable alibis. But that didn't stop their captors from torturing a confession out of them.We can only be grateful that Asif, Ruhel, and Shafiq did not sustain long-term injury from the abominable treatment they endured. Egyptian President Nasser's imprisonment and torture of Muslim Brotherhood partisans in the 1960s, whether or not they had committed any crime, galvanized their contempt of secular government and the West. These Westernized Pakistani Brits from Tipton have become more observant Muslims as a result of their ordeal. I don't suppose that they or the other 750 men who have been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay are feeling a lot of love for the United States right now.

The Russian Roulette games that occupy the middle of the film are metaphoric for morality disintegrated.  It was a graphic illustration of how cheap the value of life became as seen through American eyes in those days. More importantly, Deer Hunter addresses the question of coming home after one's civilized veneer has been stripped away.  Christopher Walken's character never does.  Though he physically survives the war, his soul dies; there was no coming home for him.  John Savage's character comes home, but leaves his soul behind along with his legs.  Only DeNiro's character manages to find some inner peace back home.  In the pivotal scene where he takes away John Cazale's pistol and plays the game on Cazale, we see the frustration of many Vietnam vets over the ignorance of those who stayed behind, with our pollyannish naivete, but also a reaffirmation for the simple value of life.  DeNiro at peace lets the deer go.  Unfortunately, the ignorance of those who did not learn the lessons of Deer Hunter have doomed many to repeat the experience.  The chickenhawks who evaded Vietnam are still waving their pistols drunkenly about, but their ammunition is much more deadly.",1.0,0,17,2,31,0,0,1411,233,1,0.1339506172839506,0.0,60.24,35.61,0.0046243596506842085,0.004594387942414335,0.004604627679872427,0.9815341995054861,0.004642425221542745,0.012048192771084338,0.000708215297450425,1,,0.0,0.75,0.0,,long,

Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver), a renowned scientist, uses Artificial Intelligence to create a super computer that can outthink any human. He installs a terminal of the computer in his house. His house is also filled with electronic, voice-activated robots and other gadgets, obeying his and his wife Susan's (played by Julie Christie) orders. However Proteus IV (voiced by Robert Vaughn) the super computer, gets a mind of its own, and decides to trap Susan inside her own home alone, while her husband is on a trip for a few months. Proteus feels trapped in the machine so decides to impregnate Susan, by inserting some chemicals into her, so that the baby will have his intelligence and can become great in the world.Firstly I would like to credit the special effects in this movie; they were astounding! For a 1977 movie, you can see how much trouble they would have gone through the movie, and it shows. Secondly, Julie Christie acted really well for her role in the movie and so did the rest of the cast. Robert Vaughn does an excellent job giving the voice for Proteus IV, the bold yet frightening voice of the machine.I am surprised no sequels were made after the movie, since it ends in a very abrupt manner, screaming for a continuation. Oh well, I guess its all for the best, since sequels tend to spoil the story started by the originals, especially for horror movies in general.This movie leaves a creepy effect on you after you finish watching it.

Certain programs go far beyond the usual high standard set, but the Christmas Special, from way back in 1989, is not one of these blockbusters. Although it is worth watching, it stands out for the topic more than the content, unlike, for example, A Charlie Brown Christmas, probably the most heartwarming animated Christmas special ever made. Although they are both &quot;losers&quot;, Bart's humor is born in more painful circumstances--Charlie Brown's dad never lost the Christmas money gambling at the dog track on Christmas Eve! In fact, the adults in Charlie Brown are never comprehensible; his world is strictly a child's world. The Simpsons is more wide-ranging, even post-modern in its humor. My favorite bit in the Christmas Special is when Bart comments that &quot;If there's one thing TV has taught me, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas.&quot;--and he even mentions Charlie Brown. [Matt Groening has said he was inspired to be a cartoonist by Charles Schultz.] As this is an early episode, fans familiar only with the recent series may be a bit disappointed in the drawings and the stiff animation; and some of the voice characterisations (especially Homer) have changed over the years.I have to qualify my recommendation of this--it's good, and Simpson lovers won't be disappointed. But I'm afraid I don't think it is great; maybe it's just me. If you love this, I'd recommend getting the book Holidays On Ice by David Sedaris; they share the same irreverent Christmas tone. {My 11 year old daughter just wandered in and said she thought it was only 3 stars; my 17 year old son opined between 3 and 4 stars....and these are kids that love the Simpsons and seldom miss an episode.}",1.0,0,25,3,73,0,1,1844,309,1,0.0907142857142857,-0.07142857142857142,67.49,34.59,0.0020013154015533535,0.3687469443801019,0.49713966831111633,0.1301062525479251,0.0020058193593031765,0.013557483731019523,0.0005420054200542005,1,,0.0,0.75,0.0,,long,

Scarlett Ed. details 'fyi'.,"Decided to spend $10 on new blu edition, despite purchase of 4 dvd set ($18 new) few years back. Played simultaneously (blu on samsung player, dvd on sony 'upscale'). MY opinions (and please don't add hateful comments if you disagree ...): even on a 50"" 720p LCD projection, picture quality is improved (colors more striking,increased clarity. Can only surmise  improvement on 1080p tv), entire 4 hr film on 1 disc -incl. overture and intermission-, audio options are many (english -mono and HD-, and dubs in spanish,german,french,italian,portuguese. Also commentary track), subtitle options even more (to above languages add swedish,'nld',danish,finnish,norwegian). RE: blu packaging (single disc): nothing fancy, with artwork that is similar to 65th box, and blu case with plastic cut-outs. I plan on placing blu disc in paper sleeve, and putting it in sleeve of multi-fold box set. That way, I still have all original extra features (single blu disc just has film), will keep very nice 65th box set, yet have upgraded film copy (total spent: $28).Recommendations: IF this is a favorite film, and you appreciate blu technology, invest the ten bucks (I consider it well spent for a 4 hr classic film). IF you appreciate the film in a fairly recent edition -not blu-, and don't 'need' another copy, then save your money! ALSO: unlike many other blu titles I own, this one DOES have 'resume' feature; and scene selections ARE available: just look for the correct menu button on remote.... and again, this 1939 film was filmed in 1.33:1, so true picture is of 'square', not wide, format ('widescreen' tv's are fairly recent phenomena. Old theater screens -and subsequent televisions- were square! On a modern tv, in blu-ray, side bars are a deeper black, so less a distraction).UPDATE: Hopefully, final 'GWTW' purchase will be the ""Scarlett edition"", which I purchased for the included 6 hr MGM documentary, ""When the Lion Roars"". NOTE: 3 disc set (single width case, within identical slipcase) includes prev. detailed blu-ray film, a second blu disc of 8 hrs of extras IN STANDARD DEF (incl. all from 65th ann. box ""plus 3 hrs new to the collection""), and disc #3 of 2-sided standard def disc of MGM doc. I paid $20 for this set ('like new'), which is what the ""Lion Roars"" cost by itself! P.S. Found a good home for single blu, and re-couped the $10! Will also give 65th set to good friend, who had never seen the film (she watched and absolutely loved it!).",0.8823529411764706,2,68,10,165,0,5,2458,413,1,0.15714328155504625,0.0,71.65,66.4,0.9943166893515106,0.0014142405739815149,0.0014245346685310362,0.0014268791421402,0.0014176562638365774,0.027664768104149716,0.00035882592158457526,1,,0.0,0.8333333333333334,1.7647058823529411,4.0,long,

I, personally, prefer Brainy Baby over Baby Einstein DVDs because there's more educational content, the videos are twice as long,  and the children are more culturally diverse. He loved Brainy Baby so much I decided to try a Baby Einstein video (Baby Santa's music box) mostly because he didn't enjoy Christmas video's made for older children (Besides Charlie Brown). He enjoyed it so much I decided to buy Baby Newton, Baby Van Gogh, Galileo, Neptune and Numbers Nursery (he already knows his numbers past 5 so I use it to teach him his numbers in Spanish). He enjoys all of them (Neptune and Van Gogh are his favorites). He likes this DVD the least but he doesn't dislike it. Basically he likes the clown, he likes the Shapes song and the rest of the video but he doesn't like the CGI crayons so he goes to play when they appear on screen. They should've only used the crayons to draw the clown, they could've used the extra minutes to add another shape to the DVD. He's learned a few shapes from it already and we've only had it for a week, because of that I'll recommend it. I'm not a die-hard Baby Einstein fan, like I said I prefer Brainy Baby (basically the same thing except alot less puppets, more babies/toddlers).

Night Shymalan has gone into the well a few too many times in regard to his Big Twist plot scenario, and two, the film was wrongly advertised as a horror movie.Perhaps my knowledge of these two facts was what let me enjoy the movie on a level that other people haven't; watching it as a dark fairy tale, a critique on today's contemporary situation, a beautiful love story, and a chilling suspense mystery. With gorgeous visuals, fantastic use of colour and a haunting violinist score, ""The Village"" is certainly a feast for the senses, whatever you might think of the actual story.In an idyllic, peaceful clearing is a hamlet where children play together, adults work together, and which is benevolently ruled over by a group of Elders. Amongst them is Edward Walker, the village patriarch and school-teacher, widowed Alice Hunt, and bereaved father August Nicolson, who has just lost his son to illness.The second generation is represented mainly through Edward's two daughters, the giddy Kitty, and the blind, spiritual Ivy, and Alice's son Lucius - a near-mute introvert who never speaks more than five words strung together unless he's carefully written out what he wants to say on a piece of paper. As well as this, there's Noah Percy, a mentally challenged young man who adores Ivy, and is consequently hurt and confused by her growing feelings for Lucius.The village is surrounded by Covington Woods, and here is where the real chills are to be found. Inside these woods dwell what the villagers call ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", strange and menacing monsters that stand between the village and the outside towns. Not that this is a bad thing, as we are told that the towns are ""wicked places, full of wicked people"". Despite this, it is important that the villagers uphold the uneasy truce between the woods and their community. A series of defences are in place to keep the creatures at bay: watchtowers, warning bells, offerings, cloaks of ""the safe colour"" and a restriction against anything that is red - this apparently attracts them. And no one is *ever* to go into the woods.But of course, we all know that anything forbidden is instantly fascinating, and that teenagers are almost genetically engineered to test the boundaries put in place around them. Therefore, whilst the other boys are playing ""chicken"" games at the edge of the woods, Lucius is exploring his own theory concerning the creatures: he is greatly affected by the death August's son, and believes that if the traveller had noble intentions (such as fetching medicines from the towns), the creatures would let him pass unharmed.But as he puts this to the test, the threat from the creatures grow - skinned animals and red marks appear on the doors. Coincidence? No way. Rules are continually broken, and lines continually crossed throughout the story - even the angelic Ivy breaks her ""no hitting"" rule. Finally Lucius (and the rest of the youths) seem frightened enough to no longer attempt passage through the woods, until an accident occurs that forces a drastic decision to be made. Now Ivy must go through the terrible woods, in order to save the life of her beloved...I know that the illogical plot-holes are so gaping that you could drive a truck through them, and I know that there are some serious problems with the final resolution, but there comes a point when you make a decision - to either go with it, or scoff at it. Most people it seems have taken the second option, and unfortunately they miss out on a lot of what the director is trying to tell us about fear, authority, rules, innocence and control - all of which have particular resonance in today's world. Whether you liked it or not, please ask yourself this: where does the real danger lie - in the woods, in the towns, or in the village itself? Are some of the choices made justified? Is retaining innocence worth the terror that goes with it?As well as this, there are a lot of things to enjoy; the afore mentioned atmosphere, and the genuine scares that Shymalan throws in (at one particularly harrowing moment three girls behind me in the theatre screamed - and I mean really *screamed*). Most touching for me however, was the love story between Ivy and Lucius - every time she puts her hand out, he's there to take it, and their discussion on the porch is beautifully performed and shot: the silent Lucius suddenly blurts out what's on his mind, whilst the talkative Ivy is struck dumb.There are some things however, that stopped me from giving it five stars, the biggest one being the sudden veer away from Lucius's plot development. Shymalan builds an interesting and endearing character, and then he abruptly drops from the action, never to return. This obviously had to happen in order to get Ivy into the woods, but we never *return* to his story. Ivy learnt some truths on her journey that she'll undoubtably share with him, but we never see how he'll react to them. For that matter, we never actually learn if Ivy was actually *successful* in her mission - does he survive or not?All in all, I enjoyed ""The Village"", and I really hope you take the time to look deeper into what it's trying to say. Everything, from the colours invoked (red, the colour of violence to yellow, the colour of cowardice) to the poetic flow of the language - which is perhaps *meant* to be a little stiff, is there for a reason. Some great performances from the actors involved, and meticulous direction and control from Shymalan - I'm definitely getting this on DVD.",0.9019607843137255,5,38,6,183,5,0,5623,974,1,0.10531135531135534,0.0,60.48,102.27,0.0011245402315639506,0.056504418014771636,0.001123204856266224,0.5592334669943226,0.3820143699030757,0.006757958385203628,0.00016037709536161548,1,,0.0,0.8846153846153846,4.509803921568627,3.6666666666666665,long,

The whole goblin battle that makes up the final third of the movie has so many individual awe-inspiring moments within it that the entertainment value of the movie is justified by that alone.  I saw The Hobbit:AUJ in IMAX 3D, and found this to be the best use of the 3D format I've seen since Avatar, though not quite at the same high level.  Both interior and exterior scenes really come alive.  Story-wise, it's been awhile since I read the book, but this movie doesn't seem to follow what I remember all that well -- not that it mattered too much to me, as I maintained interest throughout.

The next day, a young man who attended the party (Tim McInnerny) returns, and she invites him in for coffee.  During the conversation, the young man admits that he was uninvited to the party - everyone assumed that he was a guest of one of the partygoers.  Jean is puzzled, but she has no time to react, as the young man pulls a revolver out of his pocket and commits suicide.  Who is this young man and why did he kill himself in front of Jean?  During the course of ""Wetherby,"" we slowly learn that perhaps there are some connections between this young man and Jean and her friends.""Wetherby"" has all the elements of a terrific movie - an intelligent script, a crackling good premise, and a stellar cast, including Ian Holm and Judi Dench.  Unfortunately, the parts simply don't gel, largely because of the frenetic yet strangely boring direction by celebrated playwright, David Hare, who also wrote the screenplay.  The movie manages to be a bit quirky but still plays too much like a dull PBS stage adaptation; plus, ""Wetherby"" is dramatically muddled by intercutting between numerous flashbacks and unimportant subplots.  The movie attempts to say some important things about loneliness and emotional repression, but it is difficult picking out and connecting to these themes given the messy direction.  Overall, ""Wetherby"" is worth a look for fans of British dramas, but a much better movie should have emerged here.Note: I avoid including ""spoilers"" in my reviews; as most reviews include information about the young man's suicide, which occurs very early in the film, I did not view it as a potential spoiler.",0.9285714285714286,1,56,8,52,1,0,1705,286,1,0.045665266106442566,0.25,55.88,63.36,0.0027723421580542217,0.002780279483840697,0.002748800285162286,0.6952116152906175,0.2964869627823253,0.03284457478005865,0.0005442974376151399,2,5.0,0.0006048,0.8666666666666667,0.9285714285714286,,long,

I always love a good action movie the kind of sit back and not think about life and just enjoy. And I think Star Trek Into Darkness delivers that solidly. The first-ever the movie flies by at warp speed (see what I did there) and doesn't let up. Now I can start out by saying I'm not a real Star Trek fan, I grew up watching a few of the TV episodes and movies. But aside from that I don't really know much more about the universe but with that said I like what JJ Abrams has done to the series. If you want a good sci-fi action movie that I think both of the new Star Trek's deliver that.One thing I find kind of annoying is all the callbacks they have to do to the Star Trek series I know they're there for fans of the TV and movies but sometimes I think they distract from the story. Maybe because I kind of know the references that they're making I still see them as needed and I do think sometimes they are distracting.

It is a group of adult men who get together and share their lives.  Think of it as the gay ""BIG CHILL"".  One deals with loneliness and aids, two committed relationships go through infidelity and the stuggles of forgiveness.  Two gay brothers come to terms with their relationship.

There is some comedy and some action and even a little drama, but this show cannot compare to some of Joss Whedon's other shows (cough-->Buffy).  I also get the feeling that the show didn't quite know where it was going.  It's hard for me to say what exactly is wrong with this series.  It's regularly witty and entertaining, and it possesses a sort of charisma.

Perhaps the fact that I'm an avid Jane Austen fan is the main reason--I like my films to be accurate to the books, and this one is definitely much more so than the older version.  Yes, I do like the other version a lot, but this one is wonderful because it tells the S&S; story very accurately.  The characters are all their ages that they are in the book, and this film follows the book story line better.  I think the actors and actresses are very good in their roles and put on believable performances.  And the scenery is AMAZING.  I almost wanted to redo the entire theme of my house to an ocean theme.  Plus, this film is longer than the older one, so there's more time to enjoy it!  Only one objectionable scene at the very beginning when Willoughby (a male character) is seducing a young girl.  You don't see more than fingertips, bare skin, and clothing being untied--all illuminated by a fire's glow.  The scene is right at the beginning, so you can fast forward it if you have younger ones in the room.Also, ""Miss Austen Regrets"" is another good addition to your movie shelf.  I like it much better than the Anne Hathaway film ""Becoming Jane"".  This movie follows Jane Austen in her later life after she becomes well-known for her novels.

There is a machine concealed within the mind of this man that creates characters and plots so original that you never know what you are going to get. You can read his novels with the same awe that you can watch the film adaptations. A film such as ""Get Shorty"" or ""Jackie Brown"" can arguably compare to the man's work.Those two films are rarities in the sense that they function solely on the brilliance of Leonard and the social oddballs whom he produces. All of them are interesting people. You have mobsters, drifters, crooked cops, criminals, liars, cheaters, killers, and thieves elbowing each other for screen time. He uses his characters as valuable people, not fictional pawns, and they are all necessities to the story.In the case of George Armitage's train wreck, ""The Big Bounce,"" we are deprived of the luxuries of interest and captivation that the characters are supposed to create. Instead, the film takes the bold foundation of Leonard's book and mutates it into an inferior lackluster comedy, a ballsy and unfortunate mistake. Would it be wise to point out that ""The Bourne Identity"" at least came within a mile of being as good as Robert Ludlum`s novel, even if it took the plot in an entirely different direction?The cast appears to be one that was gathered at the last minute. Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Sara Foster, and Gary Sinise, all very gifted people who made the mistake of buying into the script, carry the story with some degree of willingness. For a film to have good actors and disrespect their talents is an unfortunate case that is all-too common. ""The Big Bounce"" uses the big name actors for show and narrative hinderance, not for any productive reason.Jack Ryan (Owen Wilson) is a beach bum surfer dude who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Jack drifts around the Hawaiian Islands looking for work after being released from prison, and he is hired by a local judge, Walter Crewes (Morgan Freeman), to do custodial work in and around a certain beach area. Through his unfavorable job, Jack comes across Nancy (Sara Foster), a beautiful, bikini-clad seductress who wants to run a major scam on her developer boyfriend. That would be the wealthy and powerful Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise), whose apparent ties to the mob will prove to be a challenge to her scheme.A few of the characters have hidden motives and obscure areas of reason, but the film tries to focus a bit too much on that. Instead of going ahead with their plan, Jack and Nancy tease and kid with one another in an obvious attempt to sidestep their sexual chemistry. The Freeman character stumbles around aimlessly in ignorance of the trouble that his employee is getting into. Sinise shows up only when the film is blatantly desperate for the story to continue. Charlie Sheen, who has gone unmentioned up until this point, is the puppet of the Sinise character, and his rivalry with Jack supplies an admirably humorous moment. And there is an outside player who pretty much ties everything together, however bizarre, albeit marginally brilliant, it may be.But ""The Big Bounce,"" in its feeble entirety, is a bit of a bore. The story lingers and never really engages itself, making the film seem as long as a Ridley Scott epic when it is only a brisk 88 minutes. It is a wind-up and no pitch, a clock without all of its functioning parts, the Three Stooges without Curly. Everything feels like it originated from Leonard. The movie, on the other hand, feels like it originated from a script that was written for the sole purpose of altering a story unwillingly. Whoever gave this movie a green light should not be happy with themselves. - IsaacRated PG-13; 88 minutes; Directed by George Armitage",0.7142857142857143,2,14,3,106,1,0,3842,662,1,0.11415456012913643,0.0,67.38,119.19,0.03187210658402225,0.0014129174286234168,0.001423961433902065,0.7037597064753065,0.26153130807814584,0.003643935450286309,0.0001858666964053381,1,,0.0,0.625,1.4285714285714286,,long,

Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around.

Those are the two stand out episodes of season 4. Oh my, I'm jumping ahead of myself when were supposed to be talking about Season 3.  For all you completists, I recommend you buying this volume because it's Sabrina's swan song-""Angels Remembered"". The stand out villan of this season is Zora from ""Angels In Springtime"". Dr. Slavin, the hypnotherapist that attempted to give Kelly a hypodermic filled with sodium penthethol and Zora had a little more than just a ""freindship"" going on. As well as Mercedes McCambridge's character and the murdered actress Eve Le Duex. It seemed like every season had some strong armed, lesbian type-that's what made ""Angels"" so entertaining. The first season had prison corrections officer Maxine""Max"" of Pine Parish farm prison for women and Inga, Moonshadow's masuess(mispelled). The second season had the russian Olga on her ice skates totting a real mean machine gun. The storyline was always so predictable. In the end, the angels were going to defeat the big, bad and the ugly surely. Sometimes, I would have prefered the angels to losing to the criminal or not exactly solving everything about a case just to make it more realistic. The only problem I had with the ending of the series is that of the repeated storyline with Kelly being shot again. Come on producers and writers, you guys could've done something fresh and original. Also maybe made ammends with Kate Jackson since she was an original angel, and invited her back along with Farrah. Hell, you also could of given Shelly Hack a cameo since it was referenced that she had to go back East for awhile at the beginning of the 5th seaon. So that was kind of a cop out of a way of writing a character out of a series. So the producers wanted to stick with the Kelly being shot idea-it would've been a treat for all of the fans for the five angels(past and present) and Bosley  toothat everyone be incorporated in the last episode. Again, come on Leonard Goldberg and co. it's the LAST show.  I'm sure that would've touched Charlie for sure as he was looking through the door's window to see everyone there being as family and watching over their fallen freind and angel.Julius-Allan HernandezChicago,Il.",0.5,3,15,2,88,0,0,2702,462,1,0.09089714714714714,0.0,67.99,-6.7,0.0022098269350256895,0.002191066187446536,0.3726619356081056,0.1482886444274498,0.4746485268419723,0.0055514433752775726,0.0001849796522382538,1,,0.0,0.42857142857142855,1.5,,long,

Also, it was recommended to me by Amazon. What a huge disappointment. The film is completely self-aware and self-conscious in trying to be hip and cool and cutting edge. For a film released in 2000, it is none of the above. It took me a while to realize I wasn't watching a film set in an 80's punk-lite scene. The acting was mediocre, the script was purposely vague (was that trying to be atmospheric, moody, or avante garde?), the cinematography was trying too hard to be gritty. And poor Willie Garson. How embarassing for him in a cliched role he walked through. I can't recommend enough that you avoid this movie. I watched the whole thing looking for signs of &quot;fun&quot; &quot;refreshing&quot; &quot;sexy&quot;.

Maybe if it really was organic and earthy and real instead of trying hard to be those things, it might have worked. As it is, it may seem cool to people with limited perspectives.

At the time, Guevara was 23 years old, and Granado was 29. They set out to see the continent that they called home, but had really only experienced through books, but they ended up irrevocably changed by the South America that they found.Guevara is played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who Mexican film fans will know from Y Tu Mama Tambien and Amores Perros, and Granado is played by Rodrigo de la Serna in his film debut. The two young men, Guevara a medical student and Granado a biochemist, set out on this journey for the sake of traveling and maybe meeting some girls along the way. The plan is to ride ""The Mighty One,"" Granado's less-than-pristine motorcycle from their native Argentina, up the coast of Chile, through Peru, and ending up in Venezuela for Granado's 30th birthday.Carrying almost no cash with them, they pose as prominent Argentinian doctors in order to get food and shelter along the way. Eventually, ""The Mighty One"" breaks down, and their pace slows as they make the decision to continue on foot. Here they end up inadvertantly meeting the South America that isn't described in books, poverty-stricken folks who are essentially homeless in their own land, desperate for work so they can provide for their families. Guevara and Granado end up at a leper colony in San Pablo, Peru, where Guevara notes that the Amazon River divides the ill and the healthy, and he realizes that this is not the only division he has noticed. There is a ton of injustice in the world, and Guevara is learning that maybe he needs to do something about it.The Motorcycle Diaries isn't so much about Che Guevara as it is about the plight of the poor people in the world. What we see in South America, through Guevara's eyes, are people without any opportunity to make any advances because of political divisions. These people can work all their lives and make no progress. It really makes you think about all of things in life that we take for granted, and think that maybe there's something that each one of us can do to make things better. Or at least we can try.I'm no expert on the life of Che Guevara, but he later became an associate of Castro and helped lead the revolution in Cuba that installed a Communist government. Some may say that he took his ideals too far, but this film is not concerned with that part of Guevara's life. The part of his life that is depicted in The Motorcycle Diaries certainly paints him as brash and idealistic and serves to show that it is important to stand up for what you believe in, and not simply let your world dictate who you are. Unfortunately for the people of Cuba, Guevara was later more interested in dictating what was right for them than letting them do so for themselves.",0.6666666666666666,3,51,8,66,0,0,2923,516,1,0.09983660130718955,0.30000000000000004,62.21,29.52,0.002053580082672074,0.0020362716003254604,0.0020532615522933107,0.6758467030967494,0.31801018366795974,0.017447827574409852,0.00022799817601459188,1,,0.0,0.6,2.0,,long,

Still, just like the first film, he has his fears to face. Rather than bullies, he's facing the fears inside his mind, his fear of heights on the diving board. His imagination, the one that helped rebuild Fantasia, is working against him, and when he looks down into the pool he sees roaring waterfalls and gets himself all cramped up. Bastian, in search of courage, goes to the antique store to get some books on diving. There, he spots the NeverEnding Story, now with great tracts and pages blank. Bastian takes the book once more, maybe if he reads it again he can fix what's wrong. The story takes him into Fantasia, that world of luck dragons and rockbiters, and it is once again under threat, by an Emptiness that makes all the wonderful characters and landscapes hollow and void of nourishment. Bastian has the Auryn with him, the symbol from the cover of the book, and with it he can grant wishes that could save the fantasy world. Little does he know that an evil sorcress named Xayide (the cause of the Emptiness) has a device that will steal memories from Bastian every time he makes a wish. Will Bastian be able to save Fantasia, or will the wishes make his head as hollow as the Emptiness?Though the look of the film is quite similar, (use of sets, models and matte paintings) its got a rather different feel. The casting of the characters is pretty different. Bastian's father now has hair and is a bit moodier, Bastian has gone blonde, and the Child-Like Empress has got a perm. Still, there are some characters who have been cast similar, like the child-warrior Atreyu, this time played by Kenny Morrison who I thought did a really good job here recreating the original character. It's funny though, I saw this in cinemas when I was a kid, and I didn't even pick up the casting differences! Also, this time Bastian is in the story, rather than living through Atreyu, his practically alter-ego, which changes the dynamic a bit, as does the introduction of a major villain.Though there are some fantastic places to see, there's not as much exploration of locations, and though there is a lot of dialogue, there's a little less development of character. So though I like the film, it does feel a little less in terms of entertainment and fascination. It's definitely better than the third film, though, that's for sure!It's worth checking out for fans of the first film, I think.",0.6666666666666666,1,19,3,87,1,2,2681,474,1,0.10819444444444445,0.0,66.57,34.59,0.0015950906220863887,0.034474980669704114,0.0016012253294443487,0.3939213951294499,0.5684073082493152,0.007086907870197687,0.00024857071836937607,2,3.0,0.004752,0.5,0.6666666666666666,5.0,long,

Odin disapproves and banishes Thor from Asgard, taking from him his power (Thor's hammer). Thor arrives on Earth. Thor's brother Loki schemes. Odin disapproves of Loki's actions, has a stroke or something, and banishes himSELF into a ""Norse god coma."" Thor befriends a family of earthlings. Loki schemes some more. Thor can't recover his hammer. Thor rescues the earthlings from deadly peril. Odin approves of Thor's act. Thor can finally recover his hammer. Thor fights Loki. The end. Oh, and there are also some frost giants.No, I never read the Marvel comic, but ""Thor's"" superheroic feats are definitely of the ""boys in their early teens"" variety. The movie is kind of humourous in a goofy way, and not terribly acted, which helps. In fact, the two lead performers, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, are fairly well realized, not dumbed-down characters who show good chemistry; all their scenes together look and feel right. Hemsworth plays Thor totally straight, as haughty and deific as some transcosmic sci-fi overlord might come across, with each of his Jarlsberg-sculpted lines of dialogue wearing its own Asgard style flowing opera cape; and, mercifully, not one stale pop-culture catchphrase comes from between his chiseled jaws. Portman performs her ""amused, weirded-out tolerance mixed with mature, scientific wonder"" with the right balance of gravity and a bit of humour. Perfect score there.It is in its generic take on a lot of the characters who occupy the story's margins where ""Thor"" loses most of its points, in my opinion. Anthony Hopkins, in the role of Odin, is an outstanding actor, but the character himself is flat. Odin either A.) approves or B.) disapproves of his sons' deeds, and apart from that, he has little to do: another ""stern father"" caricature without nuances or distinguishing personality traits.That Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is jealous of Thor is established from practically the first scene in which both characters appear. Showing more of an inner battle between Loki's jealous, scheming self and his loyal-to-Asgard self might have created some genuine suspense and drama, but, once again, there's nothing here to surprise the movie-viewer.The King of the Jotuns (frost giants), played to the hilt by Colm Feore, is appropriately menacing and demoniac, but he comes across as merely Loki's chesspiece, as lacking in self-determinism as a powerful gun, or, say, Thor's hammer. Having an agenda of his own might've generated more suspense among the Thor-Loki-Frost giant triangle of cross-purposes; but again, no surprises here.And Heimdall (Idris Elba), who ostensibly guards the bridge Bifrost, a bridge between Asgard and other worlds, never appears to actually guard the bridge.

Big Bomb.  And Steven Seagal plays the leader of a bomb squad.For all not-so-bad cast of Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore, Jamie Pressly, and Peter Greene, the film doesn't know how to tell a story.  Okay, actions temselves are so-so, but no tension, no exciting feeling comes from them.  As I was watching it in theater in Japan (yeah, I went to a theater all the way) in May, 2001, the guy behind my seat actually said, ""Man, during that gun-shooting scene at the climax, I couldn't tell which side is which!...  Which was the bad side, anyway?""  That kind of complaint.  Yes, because of poor editing and awful staging of the action sequences, everything looks confused and disjointed.  And with this cast.  What a waste.SO, I tell you something else.  As if reflecting the trend of the recent movie industry in Hollywood, ""Ticker"" shows many faces from music industry.  We have seen Whitney and Maria.  We have DMX in ""Exit Wounds.""  And now in ""Ticker"" we have NAS (Nasir Jones) as a cop and Chilli (Rozonda Thomas) from TLC.  Plus, veteran guitarist Clarence ""Gatemouth""  Brown can be seen playing; and in the same jazz bar scene, you can see a glimpse of Billy Preston, who played the keyboard in the legendary ""Let It Be"" session of the Beatles.

The result is, I think, rather closer to the former rather than to the latter; like Nicole Kidman as Isabel, the film expresses with gorgeous costumes and props, but lefts its heart somewhere behind.The story, very faithful to the original book, is comparatively simple.  &quot;Prince&quot; Amerigo (Jeremy Northam playing, unaccountably, an Italian) belongs to a once prosperous and  prestigious Italian family, which, however, is now finacially reduced.  He meets and keeps a romantic attachment with a beautiful woman Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman, gorgeous as ever), but without enough money he decides to marry Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), daughter of rich American tycoon and collector of  fine art Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), but still keeps on his clandestine meeting with Charlotte (who happens to be Maggie's best friend), who in turn married Adam.  This delicate equiliburium of secret love lasts only for a short time until an incident happens, when Maggie comes to realize that her husband is having an affair with her friend: until the titular golden bowl, apparently perfect, but deep inside flawed and cracked like the relations of the chracters here, shatters into pieces.The melodramatic (and some say banal) story of the book is preserved for most part, by the pen of Ruth Prawer Jhabvola, and probably no complaint would be heard from the fans of the original Henry James book.  However, as is the case with &quot;The Portrait of a Lady,&quot; it is also unlikely to convert film viewers to James fans, because the values described here is irrevocably dated.  No one, at least in the most part of Western culture today, would not look at the theme of adultery as the people in the film do.  You would think, looking at the tormented heroine such as Isabell Archer or Charotte Stant: If you don't like him, why don't you leave him?In fact, this is the point of the book, which deals with the unique situations of the people trapped in the mores of the high sphere of society, tracing how a certain set of people would act in a given time and place, according to the social and phychological codes ruling over them.  And now the film has a big trouble; in short, how can the movie interpret the subtle relations of the book (which, incidentally, is a very difficult to read, as every reader would find)?; how should the film present, before the more liberal modern audience, the believable characters that they can relate to, or at least, understand?The film, trying to overcome this problem, succeeds but not perfectly.  After Maggie realizes the truth about realtions between her husband and Charlotte, things start to change.  The people who know the truth -- Amerigo and Charlotte -- are now left in the dark while the people who didn't -- Maggie and Adam Verver -- start to gain power over the former pair.  The table has been turned, with the broken cup of gold, which is flawed....... and flawed as the film itself.  Charlotte and her husband go to American City, leaving behind Maggie and Amerigo, and thus Charlotte is virtually &quot;packed&quot; and &quot;sent&quot; to America where she will be buried alive for the rest of her life.  On the other hand, Amerigo goes back to her wife Maggie, with a &quot;Prince&quot;-like attitude, saying that he loves his wife, as if nothing had happened.  But he is also imprisoned in a family life he never cares.  This crucial part of the book is displayed so weakly that some may be left confused watching the ending of the film.This happens, I think, because of the film's cast: though Thurman and Northamm are good choice for the roles and fit in them pretty successfully, Nick Nolte and Kate Beckinsale are both greatly miscast: they just do not look like father and daughter who aodre each other.  And more to the point, both characters of father and daughter should be given, my impression after reading the book tells me, more ruthlessness, or even menace, in separating the lovers of Charlotte and Amerigo.  The fact is, they, father and daughter, conspire without saying that they need to conspire.  The tycoon father literally collects Charlotte, and that cruelty is in the book with a striking lasso image, which hangs around Charlotte's neck, and of which end Adam holds firmly.  Nolte briefly shows this side of the character when he silently and grimly supervises his wife's lecture about his pictures before the guests.  But it is not enough at all, and about Kate Beckinsale, her acting is, sorry fans, but far from satisfactory, to convince us the authenticity of the last confrontation scene between Maggie and Charlotte, which is not so much suggestive of her inner feeling, as simply confusing.All in all, the film is good; as you expect from Ivory's films, you see costumes and props that are delight to your eyes.  Still, the film shows unwittingly that some books cannot be made into film.  Probably, the most successful film adaptaion of the books of Henry James is Wyler's &quot;Heirness,&quot; which is based on &quot;Washington Square.&quot;  This gives, however, least of James's  taste.",0.75,4,57,11,215,3,0,5591,931,1,0.08601972101972102,0.175,59.87,85.69,0.0008292221892055106,0.0008301865022299983,0.22588695164316014,0.6444573975683847,0.12799624209701954,0.010194956179574315,0.00013412017167381974,17,3.5384615384615383,0.0088128,0.7058823529411765,3.0,,long,

In the same year, they made a film starring Ryan O'Neal, which Elmore Leonard, himself a great film buff, didn't like.  Now, for the newer version, Hollywood  assembled very impressive cast, plus the director George Armitage, who did a pretty good job in 'Grosse Pointe Blank.'  SO ... what happened to this newer film, which is so thin in contents?Not everything is bad, and the star Owen Wilson is not to be blamed.  He plays a very likable small-time thief Jack Ryan, who fell for a gorgeous girl Nancy in Hawaii.  Nancy (played by newcomer Sara Foster) is game for fun, and petty crimes too, but this time the stake is high.  She encourages Jack to steal $200,000 hidden in the house of one rich guy Ray, with whom she is having an affair.  The story is a typical Elmore Leonard.See this great cast.  In addition to Wilson and Foster, you get Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Charlie Sheen, Vinnie Jones, Bebe Neuwirth, Willie Nelson, and Harry Dean Stanton.  The film is entirely shot on location in beautiful Hawaii, so you can enjoy the blue sea and the landscapes.And ... what a thin story!  The main story is too cursorily told to interest us, and the pretty amusing performances of the talented actors are sadly thrown away among the weak plot, which gets lost among the pointless set-pieces.  One example.  Vinnie Jones plays a hot-tempered supervisor of a construction site.  In the middle part of the film, he terrorizes Wilson and Freeman, riding a RV.  The scene happens and ends suddenly, out of the context of the film.  The motives of characters, or the relations between them, often lack enough explanation, leaving us wonder 'who is he, anyway?'I do not know Elmore Leonard's personal reaction to this film.  He must have seen it already, and most probably he didn't like it.  Very sporadically the film shows the unmistakable touch of Leonard's -- good dialogues and unpredictable story -- but you need an ear of Tarantino to make his great books into equally great films.",0.6,2,53,9,83,2,1,2078,358,1,0.19699186991869921,0.36000000000000004,71.24,96.18,0.0020240983570357614,0.05119060956898634,0.05775543177998109,0.60681893338153,0.2822109269124667,0.02550529355149182,0.0002886002886002886,17,3.5384615384615383,0.0010368,0.5,1.2,,long,

The film is exactly about hundreds of snakes on the air plane flying from Hawaii to LA. It features Samuel J. Jackson quipping with his usual bravura acting: ""I have had it with these mother--ing snakes on this mother--ing plane!"" I really loved it, and enjoyed every word he says. He is nearly as cool as angry Jules quoting a passage from the Bible in `Pulp Fiction.'Actually I also immensely enjoyed myself watching his character and the film itself precisely because of its unrealistic, absurd, and silly story. A gangster tries to kill a witness (Nathan Phillips) who is protected and escorted by an FBI agent (Samuel J Jackson, of course), and this bad guy thinks of an ingenious idea. Don't talk about a banal plan, like hiring a hitman, bribing the cops, or anything you have seen in the Hollywood films. No, `Snakes on a Plane' proposes a much greater plan -- How about snakes on a plane that carries the witness to LA? Lots of snakes with poison let loose on the airplane should do the job, attacking everyone on board.Do they? Yes. Sit back, watch this wildly entertaining film, and just enjoy yourself. You don' t need to know much else about the film except that David R. Ellis, known for his competent works such as `Final Destination 2' and `Cellular,' did a brilliant job again. He knows what we want in this kind of summer-season fun film, and delivers it. Co-stars include Julianna Margulies, Rachel Blanchard, Sunny Mabrey, Flex Alexander, Kenan Thompson, Keith Dallas, and Lin Shaye.Though the concluding chapter is slightly weak, `Snakes on a Plane' is well-acted, the special effects are decent, and definitely fun. But the real stars are these big, bad snakes, and yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The film also gives you a tip or two about deadly snakes, and flying a jet.

This production of Marlowe's play premiered at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1969 and toured for a few months in repertory with Richard II.  It was Ian McKellen's breakthrough performance and it featured the first kiss between two men on British television.Edward was said to be tall and well built, like his father, and something of an athlete.  McKellen is rather slight in stature and plays the early scenes in an effete manner.  So the transition to a warrior king bravely defending his realm is a difficult one for the actor to execute and the audience to credit, but McKellen proves (just) actor enough to do it.Historically, we cannot be sure whether Gaveston and Despenser ('Spencer' in the play) were actually Edward's lovers or simply close companions that he favored too much.  Most dramatic depictions have retained that ambiguity, but Marlowe goes all out for an openly homosexual interpretation and this production emphasizes that aspect.  Edward and his companions kiss each other full on the lips.The play is something of a sprint through the 20 years of Edward's reign.  Edward and some other characters age rapidly from one scene to the next, with little or no break between scenes.  These sudden continuity shifts will, I suspect, make some details of the plot confusing, if you are not familiar with the history itself.  But the central story - a king more interested in his male lovers than in pleasing his wife or running the country, thus making more enemies than he can handle - is clear and simple enough.The crucial thing, with Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, is to remain true to the language, to let the dialogue carry the play.  This production does that, magnificently.  This was the performance that made McKellen a star, and rightly so.Robert Eddison won an award for his performance of Lightborn.  He appears briefly but memorably, toward the end.There is a technical problem with the sound, in that the initial dialogue of characters entering from backstage is often lost.  Nonetheless, this is an essential production.[PeterReeve]",0.7692307692307693,3,31,5,53,0,0,2148,350,1,0.12525510204081633,0.20833333333333334,62.27,66.4,0.00256447188443896,0.0025040313851549326,0.0025219667153542906,0.9898752967837636,0.002534233231288333,0.014432029795158287,0.0003579482406843971,2,5.0,0.2174688,0.7142857142857143,2.307692307692308,,long,

Barrie (1860-1937) and first came to life on the London stage in 1904.  An instant success, it has been through many adaptations but has remained a staple of both stage and screen for over one hundred years, attracting such talents as Maude Adams, Jean Arthur, Boris Karloff, Mary Martin, and Cyril Ritchard.  Among the most durable interpretations is the 1953 animated version from Walt Disney.Walt Disney Studios broke new ground in the 1930s and early 1940s with such memorable films as SNOW WHITE, DUMBO, and FANTASIA--but World War II proved a major drain on studio resources, and it was not until the release of PETER PAN that the studio once more hit its stride: a truly remarkable flight of fancy graced with stunning art, animation, and characterization, it has since become one of the studio's ""signature"" films, one of the handful of animated films by which other animated films are judged.The story differs slightly from both the earlier and later stage and film productions, but the core remains the same.  Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up, visits the Darling family of late-Victorian London--and entices the children away to Never Never Land and the joys of fighting pirates, battling Indians, rolicking with the Lost Boys, and pixie dust provided (with comic ill-will) by an honest-to-goodness fairy named Tinkerbell.  And for once the restoration is indeed all it is cracked to be: the colors are the intense, jewel-like range of Technicolor, returning the film to golden warmth of its original design; the sound is almost flawless; and the bonuses offer insight into the creative process involved.There has been some complaint that PETER PAN contains racist overtones in its portrait of Never Never Land's Indians.  The accusation of racism has haunted Disney over the years, arising in connection with DUMBO's crows, an edit in FANTASIA designed to exclude a singularly unfortunate portrait of servile ""Centaurettes,"" and THE SONG OF THE SOUTH, a film the studio has done its best to sweep entirely under the rug.  Those films must be judged on their own merits, but where PETER PAN is concerned--and I speak as a person of Native American origin--the ""Red Skins"" are not presented in a meanspirited light; they are instead as much fairtale characters as the wonderfully imagined Tinkerbell and Captain Hook.  I suspect that most children already know that cartoon characters aren't really real, but if you worry that your own children might take it amiss there's certainly no harm in pointing out that rather obvious fact.Disney bonuses tend to be hit-or-miss, but in this instance they are more hit than miss.  The ""Games and Activities"" are rather tiresome, as is the music video ""The Scond Star to the Right.""  But the behind-the-scenes features are knock-outs all the way, offering early interpretations of the story, songs that were written and later dropped, and all the rest.  The audio commentary, which includes numerous current and archival comments, is particularly informative and enjoyable.I am not one of these ""Disney freaks"" who falls all over himself with every studio release.  There are indeed Disney films, including some very famous ones, that I don't much like; there have been some ""restored"" releases that did not greatly impress me.  But there's no two ways about this one: this is a great restoration of a great animated film.

The story takes wisps from Lewis Carroll and reimagines 'Alice' as if she had a little brother to rescue from Wonderland as well as restoring herself.  Jennifer Connelly is marvelous and natural in her film debut as Sarah, the girl who must somehow outwit the Goblin King, playing his game on his terms to rescue her baby brother.There is a simmering chemistry between Ms. Connelly and Mr. Bowie, though Henson always keeps the movie's tone fairly suitable for family viewing.  David Bowie is completely believable in a role he was born to play, also contributing several songs to the movie.  My personal favorites are ""Magic Dance"" and ""It's Only Forever.""  The casting for Jareth is crucial, and Bowie completely inhabits the role.  A wispy menace and a smirking, subtle predator for both Sarah and her brother Toby, Jareth is a very good villain.Jim Henson populates the movie with original Muppet creations, and the best of them are a disagreeable gnomelike creature called Hoggle and an eerie Junk Lady.  If it's possible to overdo Muppets, this movie may have done it.  I would have rather seen much more of the fascinating dynamic between Sarah and Jareth and less of the plentiful new Muppets.

It deals with topics that are indescribable without having this review purged. The film comes with warnings all over the cover. People got up and left the cinema. People tried to boycott it and wanted to see it banned. It is an assault on morals. It is the darkest of dramas. It is only funny because a smile is all you can do to deal with what you are witnessing. It is nauseating. It is completely taboo. You do not want to tell people you saw this. You do not want to watch it with your girlfriend. You do not want to recommend it. You would feel excruciatingly embarrassed to watch this with your parents. You can not comprehend why anyone would want to make it. You feel that the actors have gone too far. You never want to see anything like it again. However, inside, deep down, you know that what you have seen is nothing short of the horrific truth about some people. You know that your parents could very well be like this. You know that your girlfriend or boyfriend may have some secrets like this. You know that your friends could well be involved in some of the topics conveyed in this film. You know all too well that the media reports on it 24/7. You know that PEOPLE DO THESE THINGS! But it is taboo, taboo and it is not you! Never you! How could you ever do such a thing or even think such things.... But there in the darkness of your soul is something that is not a hundred miles away from the topics that this darkest of film expounds on. The human condition and its western syndrome are all too capable of what is on display here.The fact remains that millions of people have experienced first-hand much of themes that this film covers. It is not something that does not happen. It does and they do. The media talk about non-stop. Any tabloid magazine is full of it. The telephone services have to deal with it - so do the police and social services. People even make money out of these things. It is terrible, awful, disgusting - but real.What most people fail to realize is that this film is all about the mentally ill who have very deep-seeded psychological problems that they can not cope with, without some help. These people can be found in any walk of life. As on display in ""Happiness"" those who suffer from these diseases of the mind are in fact everyday Joe-soaps and some with important jobs or are even authority figures. It is this angle that makes it all the more real and upsetting. It is this upper-class take on the whole problem that shows that no matter who you are, you too can suffer from these problems. Too long has this material been only played out in the hands of the seedy ""villains"" or underground freaks. Too long has cinema devoted these themes to prisoners and baddies and the elements of society who most of us never engage in. Here we see our friends, family, employers, employees, doctors and teachers all doing what they should not be doing! This is why this film deserves the acclaim that it got. It did the right thing. It did it the right way. It did it to balance out this topic that has always been dealt with unjustly.Honesty deserves praise and praise is what this film deserves.

The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic.Following Attenborough new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos, Attenborough sticks with the shorter episode format of his previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives for 6 instalments on another expert theme, Attenborough concentrates on one animal kingdom, the plants, and not only introduces what could be one of his most elaborate commentaries to date but brings us startling technical achievements in computer generates imagery for biological pathways and revolutionary time-lapsed photography techniques that even moves with the subject matter. This may be his best outing since Life on Earth.While Life in the Freezer being the first of the shorter life series might have been low in the amount of diversity, The Private Life of Plants is at the other end of the spectrum, with so many variations from microbe-sized plants, seaweeds, mosses, flowers and trees the show ranges from the atom size to the monstrous, each with maybe more information than several Attenborough shows put together, this series blows you away from the opening sequence to the last where Attenborough stresses that we are doomed if we destroy it all, you have never seen an Attenborough Life presentation like it. The time-lapsed photography is incredible as we see plants moving in ways that you would never have thought possible, paying special detail to how they can climb by coiling or using tension to move, some plants are even meat eating predators that respond almost instantly when trapping an insect or secrete glue like chemicals to stick them to it. We see plants growing inside rocks in extreme environments such as the Antarctic and above the clouds on mountainous plateaus where they exist nowhere else, trees also bigger than blue whales and some thousands of years old. There are lots of symbiotic relationships to birds and insects but more importantly to fungi. While fungi aren't plants, Attenborough still devotes a large segment of one episode to them because they are so important. Major themes include how plants travel, how they grow, how they flower, how they compete with each other, how they live together and how they survive rough conditions. The sheer scope and volume of work packed into 6 episodes makes this quite simply one of the best documentaries ever made.",1.0,0,63,8,45,0,0,3099,508,1,0.1460375316507392,0.55,43.09,29.52,0.0018845594580369242,0.001858888838556146,0.5032656745735128,0.4911140568830271,0.0018768202468669437,0.02032913843175218,0.0003225806451612903,5,5.0,0.0247968,0.8,0.0,5.0,long,

Kurt holds nothing dear or sacred: not the 30-yr employee he ruthlessly fires, not his secretary just longing for a nice new dress (from another store, though!), not even the destitute young woman who must sleep with him in order to be hired, played by Loretta Young. Kurt doesn't expect people to like him, though, and that's what makes him AOK. You may hate him, but you've got to respect him--in his own weird way, he's fair. In his very first scene, he tells off the entire board in what would be the ordinary worker's fantasy, telling them, &quot;I took this store when it was a heap of junk!&quot; and made it a money maker, demanding and getting a new contract at twice his salary. As he faces being ousted by the stockholders, you find yourself rooting for him to maintain control of  his cash register kingdom. Loretta Young is very appealing as Madeline, who can't seem to stay clear of the robotic Kurt; there is a very funny golddigger in the story too, who is hustling the board member who's supposed to keep his eye on Kurt, not the golddigger's shapely gams.

And have a fridge full of beer.Where to start?  This movie is an abortion all the way through.  Elizabeth Berkeley pretty much ruined her career by starring in this junk.  Even accomplished actors like Robert Davi and Kyle McLachlan are still living it down.  The only person who seemed to be enjoying herself is Gina Gershon; one suspects that she realized how trashy this was, and decided to have fun and give a campy performance as a wink to the audience.One problem some viewers might have is the script's rampant misogyny.  Women are shown as either innocent victims or drug-addled, backstabbing, borderline homicidal whores.  Supposedly Paul Verhoeven will have nothing to do with Joe Ester-whatever anymore because of this movie's misogyny.Of course, when a movie is as badly written as this is, the misogyny is less offensive and more a sign of the limited psyche of those involved, and something to laugh at.The rampant nudity becomes numbing after a while, and even though there's also a generous amount of male flesh on view, in typical Hollywood sexism, you never get full frontal male nudity in this.  Boo.I'd give this one star for being so bad, but at the same time it's so amusingly trashy and unintentionally campy that I find it fun for a few drunken laughs.

Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself.The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.Then again, S&H; can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither. It tows the line and makes it a worthwhile experience in the end, and an albeit hilarious one, at times. It's occasionally dumb, it has an interminably slow first act, and I can't say I'd watch it again. I can't say I didn't have fun the first time, either.

The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.Here's How I rate the movies in this collection:Great:CounterblastFury of the Wolf ManGood Against EvilHow Awful About AlanThe Lost City Part 1The Lost City Part 2The Lost WorldMaciste in HellThe Nightmare Never EndsPurple Death From Outer SpaceRadio RanchTerror at the Red Wolf InnGood:Alien ContaminationAlien SpeciesAlien ZoneAll The Kind StrangersAtomic Rulers of the WorldAttack from SpaceBeast of the Yellow NightThe Day the Sky ExplodedDeath Warmed UpThe Doomsday MachineEmbryoEnd of the WorldEternal EvilEvil Brain from Outer SpaceFrozen AliveHouse of the Living DeadIdaho TransferThe MansterMenace from Outer SpaceThe Mistress of AtlantisNight FrightPanicThe Phantom CreepsPiranha, PiranhaReturn of Dr. MabuseRobot PilotStar OdysseyTheyThis is Not a TestUFO: Target EarthUnknown WorldThe War GameWarriors of the WastelandWerewolf WomanBad:The Alpha IncidentPrisoners of the Lost UniverseRing of TerrorShadow of Chinatown",0.9090909090909091,2,35,6,15,0,0,1325,188,1,-0.038119658119658124,0.0,31.25,73.85,0.00556266358316712,0.16763446234437823,0.3046035811971668,0.3186621548744711,0.20353713800081685,0.026415094339622643,0.0006855889208830385,1,,0.0,0.8695652173913043,1.8181818181818181,,long,

What this is, is an agonizing, angst, totally 100% testosterone movie that got away from the Director Claire Denis. There is no point in trying to convey a story-line to you as there was no script, no script, no acting, no character to follow, no hero, only sweaty Legionnaire's running around the desert posing sometimes naked and bare chested. And even this is a bore.I really liked Denis' Chocolat, it had character plot and great acting, but she was directing mostly women. She did not know what to do with all these men in a desert, running around looking at each other as if in a daze. And the ending was really too much for anyone to bare.

I mainly chose this movie because of the actors, not because I had read the book.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good film.  A bit predictable at times, but a good story.I thought the story concept worked well, and I really enjoyed all the scenes shot at the Outer Banks.  We used to vacation there, and it is a wonderful place to go and relax.  The only part of the movie I didn't like (and my wife didn't like it either) was the ending.  It seems like the director looked at his watch, noticed the movie was already over two hours long, so he decided it needed to end in 10 more minutes.  The ending just doesn't do a very good job of putting all the pieces together.Like some of the other reviews, I recommend renting this movie instead of buying it.  It is a good movie to watch with your significant other, or possibly even a good &quot;date movie&quot;.  It does talk about some pretty heavy topics (like death of a spouse, and divorce), so be warned....not everyone is happy in the end.",0.8571428571428571,1,22,3,41,0,0,1141,211,1,0.32962121212121215,0.5,80.41,9.21,0.0025480116887893122,0.24302738000903035,0.05488743423912478,0.0025667319316509396,0.6969704421314046,0.019281332164767746,0.0007505629221916437,1,,0.0,0.75,0.8571428571428571,,long,

I also found it amusing with the chemistry between Kouhei and Hazuki it was a mix between friendship,family camaraderie,and a little bit of romance. The romantic part between Kouhei and Hazuki was a little weird though even if Hazuki was a vampire of unknown age at the time it still looked like a junior high school girl trying to have a relationship with an adult man in his 20's. I will tell reviewers that there is no actual scene of any kissing or any physical romantic scenes between them except for the parts when she drinks blood from Kouhei's neck.

Yah, although the theme of this film is not about cocaine per se (and it is not explicitly mentioned and only introduced by a knowing low-life nose candy mimic from newly- minted gangster (stage gangster, that is) Humphrey Bogart) that line can serve as a metaphor for what this film is about. In theory it is about superstition (the old chestnut probably no used much anymore about the fate of the last of third on a match, an old wives tale but just in case, beware, okay. But really it is about going from riches to rags quick when that nose candy puts the squeeze on you.Despite my plaintive plea the three gals in this story Mary, Ruth, and Vivian who have known each other since grade school (which we are aware of fromthe beginning shots that set the story line up) play this devilish game out when they met later in life during the Great Depression. Naturally poor little distracted, alienated, and bored rich girl Vivian was the last and thus fated to die first.

Against this admittedly true and valid point, why not consider the following:- Smith cues very well, is very personable, and her enthusiasm is charming- Ansuya is never far from view, and she is the belly dancer to beat all, in my opinion; the other ladies also contribute well to an understanding of how the moves are done- the various belly dance moves are fun and interesting- the pace is good, with just the right amount of instruction- the set is well designed and very tasteful- the program is well organized and appealingly shot, with good production values- all the ladies look lovely.  It is perhaps slightly unfortunate that Smith's midsection is on the masculine side, with rather little curve in it, but that has almost no effect on how she demonstrates the moves. And if, for example, she is not quite doing front-back-back on the hip drop, the other dancers are, and it's clear what should be done even if Smith has some difficulty with it (shoulder shimmies seem to give her a lot of trouble, but I happen to find them easy)- the music is excellent, enhancing the atmosphere in a general way but also providing perfect accompaniment for the dancing- there is an upmarket feel about the program:  just the right degree of exoticism but no louche overtones- Smith gives much air time and credit to Ansuya, who also provides demonstration dances and a tutorialIn sum, well worth the money.

'Japan is rare and unique,' said James Clavell creator of John Blackthorne, 'Anjin' in Japanese, which means 'pilot.'Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) portrays an Englishman, pilot major of a Dutch fleet, who is shipwrecked on the turbulent waters off the 'Land of the Gods.' England's enemies (aristocratic warlords, British colonial, Portuguese traders, Jesuit missionaries) now await him...He is caught with his crew by Japanese warriors, and forced to listen as to understand the Japanese language and treatment... The audience - like him - struggles to catch what is going on, as no subtitles in the film...Blackthorne is surrounded by hundreds of warriors all dressed up with Japanese multicolored wardrobes fastened firmly by an obi (a long wide sash that holds the two swords). We are in presence of samurai, where 'physical courage and prowess are at a premium.'The English navigator starts a new life far from home, a new transformation of way of living, thinking and acting, from an uncivilized primitive prisoner to a man of strength, honor and courage...In this epic exposition we see:- Violent scenes of feudal Japan: Omi (Yuki Meguro) in his first meeting with Blackthorne beheads a man for not bowing in respect to him... Pieterzoon (Edward Peel), a man of Blackthorne's crew, is brought from a pit to be cook alive in a large deep pot... A companion Croocq (Steward MacKenzie) is pulled up from boiling liquid...- Intricate and complicated political plots: When Ferriera (Vladek Sheybal), a Portuguese trader, in the presence of Father dell'aqua (Alan Badel) gives Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) and Mariko (Yoko Shimada) protection on the Black ship in return for the Englishman... When Rodrigues (John Rhys-Davies) has been overboarded... When the Ninja warriors attack Osaka Castle...- Dramatic scenes: Blackthorne's intend to commit seppuku... Mariko's seppuku frightening scene... When a disgraced warrior Yabu (Frankie Sakai) commits instant seppuku (hara-kiri).- Amusing moments: Blackthorne in his first Japanese bath in Anjiro... When he teach Toranaga the lively steps of the hornpipe... When he begins his 'mad dance' moving up and down in order to permit Toranaga escape from Osaka Castle...- Cultural exposition of the traditional Japanese woman: Her moods and feelings, her emotions, her reactions... Mariko badly beaten by her husband... Mariko treatments so affectionate, sweet and loving... Mariko's bath scene... Her risky love affair...- Best moment of the whole mini series: Blackthorne becomes a samurai!Filmed in epic proportions, with breathtaking cinematography, super acting, and great special effects (few arrow-in-the-chest scenes; the burning of 'The Erasmus;' the earthquake), this full-length version of ""Shogun"" is fair to James Clavell's colorful best-seller...The Jesuits (Friar Domingo, Father Sebastio, Father dell'Aqua, Father Alvito) are interpreters, writers of the first Japanese dictionary, who all share the commerce of silk between Japan and China...Richard Chamberlain appears fervently with noble ambition, firm and dominate as the Westerner who is taken by force as a prisoner, who hates his captors, but little by little is seduced by their culture...Toshiro Mifune performs with great dignity a powerful legendary figure who unifies several political factions into one nation under his authority as Japan's first Shogun!John Rhys-Davies plays Rodrigues, the Portuguese pilot, with a big sense of humor...Yoko Shimada (Mariko) is the 'perfect vision.' a woman of great beauty and rarity, delicate and fragile, a true precious jewel of the Orient!",0.8181818181818182,2,43,6,213,0,3,3847,583,1,0.1394760332260332,0.5,54.63,14.63,0.001722404712502889,0.0017188704752724004,0.04512116224020042,0.9497243752956677,0.0017131872763566747,0.011177540940992981,0.00021262521262521263,5,3.5,0.0011232,0.75,1.6363636363636365,5.0,long,

The Climactic space battle between the Death Star II and the Rebel Fleet looks fantastic, as does the speeder bike sequence on Endor.Unfortunately, the fantastic visuals aren't matched with an equally fantastic story. The basic story isn't bad, but it's the overall vibe of the movie that detracts from the story. What I mean is, the way the story is presented, the end never seems in doubt even for a moment.A New Hope works in large part because the Galactic Empire seems truly intimidating: Darth Vader fails to display even a modicum of human emotion or behavior, and the Death Star's powers are effectively demonstrated with the ease in which the battlestation destroya Princess Leia's home planet of Alderran.  The Empire Strikes Back, similarly, creates a feeling of dread and hopelessness in the viewer, especially with the gigantic walkers (impractical though they were) that are attacking the rebel base on Hoth. The sheer size and beast-like countenance of these vehicles are actually frightening. In both movies, the Empire is presented as a serious opponent that gives the viewer no doubt as to why they are in charge of the galaxy and why the odds are stacked so insurmountably against the rebellion. The rebel alliance, arguably, should have really been defeated at Yavin when the Death Star reached firing range, however they survived and triumphed due to Luke Skywalker's abilities with the Force and his miracle ""exhaust port shot."" This is acceptable to viewers who demand a certain level of realism (but accept absolutely the make-believe elements of science fiction movies) because it is faith rather than machinery and pragmatism (and good rathter than evil) that actually triumphs.It goes without saying that in The Empire Strikes Back it was the Imperials who rightfully emerged triumphant because of their superior resources and the iron will of Darth Vader, and also because it was necessary for Luke to be placed in a vulnerable and seemingly inescapable position against Vader.The problem with Return of the Jedi, in my opinion, is that it seems more of a children's movie than anything else. The results are never in doubt, mostly because the movie fails to make many viewers respect the power of the Empire, and the entire movie takes on a carnival atmosphere with no latent feeling of fear and dread that the first death star, the Imperial walkers, or stormtroopers created. This is done at many points in the movie:1 - The efficacy of Imperial ""elite"" troops is seriously put to question when they are bested by the ewoks, who somehow harness the power of cuteness to deflect blaster bolts and defeat stormtroopers with what amounts to a bunch of Dennis the Menace slingshots.2 - Darth Vader seems somehow less threatening in this movie. In the first Star Wars movie it was hard to imagine Darth Vader sleeping or eating lunch or talking with his buddies in the Death Star's break room when off duty, but in this movie it is easy to imagine him sitting on the toilet while reading his wife's copy of Glamour because the Emperor stole his copy of GQ and there's nothing else to read. This is probably because in the first two movies he seems more like a robot where as in this one he seems like some tall guy wearing a costume.3 - the second Death Star doesn't seem the least bit threatening. Part of this is because the Imperial engineers don't seem to have learned their lesson from the first Death Star's loss, and wnet ahead to design the second battle station not only with the same exhaust port leading to what is vaguely described as a ""main reactor,"" but make it large enough for an entire squadron of starfighters to fly through, unlike the first Death Star which was so small only missiles could get in. Perhaps if the Death Star fired at some random planet much larger than Alderran it would demonstrate to the audience that this second Death Star is stronger than the first one. This might at least distract the audience from the fact that the manner in which this battle station is destroyed in the same way that the first one was4- Luke Skywalker seems like a gigantic wuss. It is difficult to imagine a Dark Lord of the Sith being out-duelled by this sniveling dork.5 - Han Solo - Harrison Ford looks like he's tired of his stupid vest, and doesn't seem to be very into his role. Either that or he isn't all that good an actor.6- Lando -- Billy Dee Williams demonstrates once and for all that just because you can sell cheap beer on TV commercials it doesn't mean you can fool an audience into thinking you're a starfighter pilot.7 - The video game atmosphere of the space battles -- the Empire can't seem to shoot straight and loses flocks of TIE fighters left and right, where as every Rebel craft shot down is something of an event to be mourned over. These people are supposed to be the Empire's finest pilots?8 - The Star Destroyer ""Executioner"" (the big blue-colored one that Darth Vader rose in) goes down just because an a-wing crashes into its bridge. This is tantamount to a nuclear aircraft carrier going down because it took a kamikaze to the control tower. Of course it would be disabled or at least severely damaged, but it's hard to imagine the whole thing going down. The Executioner is many times larger than any aircraft carrier and the idea that one crashing fighter can destroy the whole thing when its ""shield is down"" begs the question why the Rebels don't just crash into every star destroyer's bridge after knocking down the shields.Overall this movie is entertaining and worth watching, but it would probably be better if the Empire seemed like a geniune threat with genuine power, rather than the inept foils for the Rebels' attack that they became in this film.",0.16666666666666666,5,35,6,133,1,0,6013,1046,1,0.026865719949832098,0.5,57.44,73.85,0.0009166965440014712,0.0009123355396284922,0.25926738812650146,0.2549249683695719,0.4839786114202967,0.005820721769499418,2.7713113845471675e-05,1,,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.8333333333333333,5.0,long,

THE LOST WORLD is a very early (1925) example of both. Professor Challenger (Wallace Beery) puts together an expedition party to return with him to the amazon jungles, in order to prove his claims of living dinosaurs. Once there, we are treated to some ultra-cool dino-battles and high adventure! First, we see a pterodactyl flying around. Then, we get to watch an allosaurus fight triceratops! Our human heroes become a sideline to the spectacle before us. Willis O'Brien handled the stop-motion with care and detail (the dinos ""breathe"" and check out the stringy saliva / gore in the allosaurus' gaping maw). Soon, a  brontosaurus thunders along, eating plants and minding it's own business, when -BAM!- Another unprovoked allosaurus attack! During it's fight for survival, brontosaurus falls over a cliff, landing in a mud-pool, stuck but still alive. Challenger and company decide to cage the beast and take it back to London. Upon their return, the mega-ton monster gets loose, running amuck through city streets, becoming the world's most dangerous vegetarian. Chaos ensues, with many classic moments of dino-destruction and fun.

It has been such a long wait for this record--a dangerous situation, since expectations can run so high.  Amazingly, though, Walter and Donald did everything right.  The songwriting  is right on (it's amazing how well these two complement each other, whereas  I tend not to like the songwriting on their respective solo material).  The  playing is right on.  The sound and the mood are just what you're looking  for in a Steely Dan record.I suppose the biggest risk here was that  Walter and Donald would want to update their sound for the nineties.  Thankfully, they did not attempt to do this.  A listener who was not aware  of the release dates would have no reason to think that this did not come  out a year after Gaucho.What else is there to say?  I could go into  detailed descriptions of the songs and the playing and the lyrics, but, if  you've memorized the previous Steely Dan records, you already know these  things.  This is a great Steely Dan record, just like you'd want a Steely  Dan record to sound.  Get it.

As a young man who was active in the comics world during the release of The Watchmen, I can attest to the astounding and ground-breaking impact it had on storytelling, art, and vision. It was the Star Wars of comics - laying waste to the uninspired, underperforming and often flat world that was comic books at the time. When it ended its 1-year run - The Watchmen had changed an entire industry - it was THAT amazing.But this visually rich film fails at capturing, what is at it's core, a mystery. Who Is killing The Watchmen? And why?The film is so non-linear that it's very near impossible for the average viewer to take in and process. It's 1953, now it's 1985, now it's 1971, now it's 1944, now it's 1979, now it's... you get the point. Too muddied, too disconnected, too many plotlines to properly thread together a meaningful story.As a fan, I 'got' what was being offered, and if we were all comic geeks, I think we would be unanimous at this stupendous achievement.Sadly, and I think this is lost amongst fellow nerds, MOST of the audience are not, and will not, become hardcore fans just to see a film. That Director Snyder sought out the approval of the fans is what unfortunately sinks this film into the mess that the average viewer has to sort out for themselves.What should have been the focal point, as in the original storyline, was Rorschach. It should've been made clear that it's from his perspective all the surrounding stories swirl. He is us - the audience. We're being taken along a complex  investigation about the deaths of his former comrades. THAT should've been the foundation upon which this story should've been told. But what we get is a mishmash of introductions, flashbacks, intersecting plotlines, dropped plotlines, missed & missing connections - all carried along with spectacular visuals that sadly lose their meaning since it's not placed within the context of  a story that we can readily absorb.Solution: You start at the past. An introduction of characters; a brief synopsis of who and what they are; what their relations are to one another; what happened to them throughout the years. Boom - 25 minutes of film - the stage is set for the rest of the story. But what happens? Well... what happened.Watching the Watchmen is like eating cotton candy - visually and texturally appealing, but ultimately leaving you empty inside.",0.3333333333333333,6,24,3,95,3,0,2574,443,1,0.01348837209302327,0.0,70.84,9.21,0.002254598636786247,0.0022395348211854318,0.2198649805890417,0.4060911094580992,0.3695497764948875,0.009324009324009324,0.00012944983818770226,2,4.0,0.0,0.3,2.0,3.0,long,

It's very difficult to find something you can use at home that is both effective and fun. For me, this dvd covers everything: carnival dance moves, interactive arm coordination (very important for fighting gravity wars), strength trainers, glut action, and torso pops and twists from every angle. The bonus dance sequence includes speed training for samba steps which is so great for my calves.With the bonus segment, the dvd lasts for 55 minutes: 6 minute warmup, three 12 minute dance routines, 6 minute cool-down (strengthener), 7 minute samba bonus. Each dance sequence works the body in a different way & angle - I found myself popping out my torso in the 'island' like dances of the 1st segment and then smoothing out the torso in the 'New Orleans' & Trinidad-like carnival dances of the 2nd segment. The 3rd segment is powerful for upper & lower body strength and my only equipment was my own body weight. The warmup and cool-down are beneficial exercise sequences all on their own!A couple of other reviewers mentioned that there are cueing issues where you may not get a heads up on what's coming up next with each sequence.  My best recommendation (as should be done with all exercise workouts) is to look at the workout before you practice it. A few of the movements may seem strenuous the 1st time so I found it best to do movements at my own level the first week like 'waving the flag' (lifting 1 leg behind you as the arms lift simultaneously in front of you). Also the 3 dancers tend to do things in 8s, 4s, 2s, then singles & repeat the entire routine with more sassiness a couple more run-throughs. There is also the wonderful option of music-only  where you can just listen to the hip-shaking music and dance.I've gain so much strength & just keep getting better & better each time. The strange thing is that I am still not at all bored & burn a lot of calories which is difficult to accomplish since I am a bellydancer. Kimberly is always genuinely smiling and that positive attitude is a great influence any time of the day. Plus the tropical setting is also a great eye pleaser. I don't see myself rotating this 'dance party' out of my fitness schedule any time soon & it's already been over a month!

Compared to the superb Kenneth Branaugh version, Gibson's Hamlet seems dazed, drugged, and lackluster. His lines are spoken with no particular emphasis - everything sounds flat and dull. Initially, I felt this was an attempt to portray Hamlet as dazed and overwhelmed by his father's death, but even his descent into madness seems dull and lifeless and pales strongly in comparison to the manic babbling and hyper antics of Branaugh's Hamlet. I appreciate an attempt at a numb, grief-stricken performance, but it just doesn't work dramatically, and Hamlet requires more energy than Gibson displays here.I will also add that Glenn Close, whom I usually respect, seems overly campy and bubbly here, with very little attempt at any facade of widowhood. This contrasts, too, with the Branaugh version, where Gertrude is superbly displayed as a politic queen, with a perfect facade of mourning, overlaying an underlying joy. This duplicity is more intriguing than the dancing, giggling child-queen we get from Close, and I found it strikingly simplistic.Also very annoying is that several scenes are cut out of place, lines are spoken out of order, and soliloquies are cut short. This chops the drama badly and while I understand that some people feel that Shakespeare must be made more brief in order to be more accessible, there must be a better way with this.This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.

That's what we need more of and this movie's got it.,"I hate predictable movies with canned characters, which is why I loved this movie. The stereotypical bad guy is thoroughly bad while the stereotypical hero is always good (or always does the right thing). Here, in this movie, is the complexity of life - we all have a hero and a villian in us. People just aren't that simple as typically cast in movies. The plot of Crash you can get from most of these 200+ reviews, so I won't rehash too much of it except to say that it is a drama about several different lives that all wind up ""crashing"" together. I love how they managed to keep the movie interesting at every step, each character believable and well-played, yet at the same time you never knew what was going to happen next.The message at the end is that life is complex and so are people. The good guy doesn't always win, which is not as horrible a thing if there is no clear good guy or bad guy.

Better toward the end.,"I've only watched the TV version of these Kai episodes and there are several things I like better and things I don't like as much and things I don't like at all. And this is a review for the entire Dragonball Z Kai thing not just part one.the things I like better: redrawn animation, some of the animation is redrawn and much ""pretty"" I guess you could say. but most of the original artwork is used, I mean they couldn't redraw the whole thing. The story and the episodes move a lot faster and they're more to the point. they cut out long drawn out sections that had nothing to do with the story at all so it's I guess roughly 100 episodes? if you see that wrong please tell me and show me where a full list of episodes is in a link, thank you:) in the earlier episodes a lot of the colors were redone so you know what color they actually are instead of say for instance, vegeta and Nappa's armor is some funky brown orange and Yellow when hearing Raditz over his radio in the original and in this the colors are like normal saiyan armor. things like that.the things I don't like as much: some of the voices sound different but are the same people actors. they completely cut the Garlic Jr. saga, I didn't like this as much because you got to see Gohan show his powers off a good bit, although it wasn't missed, that and the great saiyaman saga were the worst of all.the things I don't like at all: There isn't near as much violence if any at all, where there is violence it's filled in with the same color as the skin is. even Cartoon network showed more violence than this. Many of the bad guys' voices are different, didn't like that much because I guess I was just use to the other ones. 95% of ALL the dialogue is different and that's annoying to me because sometimes they'd change what they were talking about completely. It also looks like they did not put the Buu saga in here since that's my favorite saga just because it should've ended at the Cell saga and Goku goes super Saiyan 3.those are my opinions on the Dragonball Z Kai thing. pretty good, ok, not all bad, plenty of action too. recommended for the beginner because of less long Grunting sessions which I kinda enjoyed because of the anticipation of the fight. for a true fan such as myself just watch the originals online.",0.5,2,37,7,59,1,0,2292,431,1,0.13444940476190476,-0.09999999999999992,74.93,93.3,0.0381899577383081,0.0016247979525896665,0.19530981508555495,0.0016107310133713154,0.763264698210176,0.01614310645724258,0.00021805494984736154,1,,0.0,0.4,1.0,,long,

The man is hilarious and he's very talented. I was shocked when he did not receive an Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance in 2006's Somkin' Aces.At least he's back in another starring role as Don Ready, in the very hysterical The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard. I recently had someone tell me that Piven's portrayal of Don Ready, reminded them of ""his character Ari Gold from Entourage; only sleazier and with less money!"" Entourage being my absolute favorite show, I couldn't agree more.His character in this film, Don Ready, is the ultimate used car salesman. His business card, says it all: ""Don Ready: I move cars, Mother F***er!"" You could say he lives, only to sell cars. It's his darkest passion and the only thing he has going for him. He lives his life on the road; traveling from dying dealership to dying dealership, with his mission being to restore order and keep the place on its feet. As depressing as this life may sound, he is more than content with it. Or is he?When Ben Selleck's (James Brolin) beloved dealership meets the head of its demise, he gives Don Ready a call. Don and his crew come a running.His teammates are Babs (Kathryn Hahn), who uses sexual advances towards desperate men to move her share of the cars; Jibby (Ving Rhames) who looks tough, but admits he has never made love to woman; and Brent (David Koechner) who tells us while he's eating at a strip club, that he doesn't think he can eat breakfast at any place but a strip club.They have to sell more than 200 cars over Fourth of July weekend. It should be no problem for this team of ruthless salesmen. But what Don didn't plan on, was falling for his new boss' daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro). Is he an untamable stallion, destined for life alone on the road, or will she win his heart and cause him to fail at his goal of clearing her father's lot?As if that's not enough pressure for Don, if he does in fact fall short of moving these cars, Selleck's lot will be handed over to Ivy's scumbag,, soon to be father-in-law, Stu (Alan Thicke). Ivy's fianc&eacute; Paxton (Ed Helms) is a complete tool, who dreams of becoming famous in his three-man `boy-band' comprised of men all over the age of 30. For a guy like Don Ready, the challenge is stiff, as he will naturally want to have the girl and sell the goods.The movie is jam-packed full of some of the funniest comedians out there right now. One of whom is a rock-star in the world of comedy and is un-credited in the film and will remain so in this review. Trust me, you will appreciate the surprise.The film is dirty but witty and we like it that way. To shed light on a few of these moments; Ben Selleck obviously has some closeted homo-sexual tendencies, because he is constantly flirting with and sexually harassing Brent. Selleck also has a 10-year-old son who due to an abnormal birth-defect, looks like he's 30. Babs is completely infatuated with the 10-year-old nonetheless, and is relentlessly trying to come up with ways to seduce him, without his knowing he's being seduced. It sounds like it could be bad, but trust me it's all executed very well and it's hilarious.No punches are pulled folks. If you think they've gone too far with one inappropriate joke or gag, then you may want to duck because another one is sure to follow. There is racial humor, sexual humor (sometimes even involving parachutes and sex toys) and there are plenty of stabs at car salesman schemes and scams that will have you rolling.There are a ton of enjoyable comedies with fast-talking, foul mouthed, self involved guys, who think they are big shots, and this is one of them.

Overall, it seems more instructional in choreography than in belly dance technique, and Jillina filmed choreography that she uses elsewhere. Learning choreography technique and getting ideas from this video can be helpful, but learning music composition is fairly crucial to this process as well if that's what you're seeking. While Jillina can belly dance and put together choreography, the tone of her videos is directed at the American consumer, or it is, rather, commercialized. By her own admission, her background is in Jazz dance. I recommend that if you are looking for technique than the best thing to do is enroll in a class with a teacher you are comfortable with and if you use videos, use them to augment your lessons. Videos, as true in this set, will not teach you emotional interpretation of music and using expression like you'll see with authentic Egyptian performers (this is much more than remembering to smile while you dance).",0.7142857142857143,4,15,2,26,0,0,1100,180,1,0.3458333333333334,0.0,53.85,77.91,0.8112874901186528,0.006172816926864694,0.0061459125937647005,0.17020883247363058,0.006184947887087108,0.013636363636363636,0.000648760866744518,1,,0.0,0.6666666666666666,2.857142857142857,,long,

The documentary (TT49:10, 4:3 aspect) is excellent and is mostly in color, consisting of color and especially B&W newsreel footage and portraits, Eva Braun's famous color home movies, dramatizations that are occasionally overwrought, and informative interviews. Interviewed are authoress Gitta Sereny (Albert Speer, 1995), Hitler's housekeeper, his SS bodyguard, Braun's housemaid, and her cousin. Not interviewed is Hitler's stenographer, Traudl Junge (1920-2002), who recently appeared in Blind spot (2002) as well as in World at war (1973-74). Adolf & Eva also has readings from Hitler's speeches and writings and from Braun's 1935 diary, The video quality is very good to excellent, including of the newsreel footage and, significantly, of Braun's home movies.

Mix in giant ""robots"" fighting in a city scape, some unique but cookie-cutter characters, romance, and typical anime characteristics. In anime, characters usually yell out commands or certain words describing their mode of attack. To an average movie viewer, this seems absurd and unreal, but it is almost standard operating procedure in the world of anime. The power of an attack is gauged by how loud the character yells the command or description.The premise of the story is described in the first few minutes of Episode 1, which does a good job of getting people up to speed without spending too much time explaining the ""origin."" Special people with telekinesis abilities are able to pilot special craft that can transform in robots, similar to those in the Robotech series. Some of the characters appear to be reincarnated versions of heroes that fought the evil angels thousands of years ago.The animation is polished and professional. I believe some of it is CGI or computer animated. The voice acting is very good as they generally hire the same English speaking voice actors for anime movies or television serials.I wouldn't recommend it for extremely young viewers or those that can get offended by slightly more mature imagery and context. The box states it is rated ""MA"" but I'd say it is more along the lines of PG-13. There are some homosexual overtones between Reika and one of the recent female element recruits (the one with the glasses). This is also described on the official Aquarion website showing a ""heart"" icon linking the two characters. The elements seem to experience something similar to an orgasm during the robot merging process, and there are some questionable positions of the characters during certain scenes. I find that these are generally ""accepted"" by parents in Asian cultures since many of the children's books have similar content.Some of the audio is poorly mixed, such as that of Episode 12. It's almost as if everyone is whispering but the music/score is overly loud. Toma and the enemy Dark Angels use some type of telepathy to communicate and the volume is so low that I don't even bother trying to decipher what they are saying. The theme song is extremely catchy and they even show off the Aquarion logo on the blue Aquarion robot arm. It goes to show that branding is still important in a post-apocalyptic world.I noted how much Aquarion's eyes resembled the headlamps on a Mazda 6. I am actually a fan of technology so I was impressed with the amount of detail they rendered into the Aquarion meshes.I am anxious for Part 2 to be released (July 15, 2008) so I can find out what happens in the last half of the story, however I feel that they ought to have released the entire season in one box set. To sum up Aquarion in one sentence: Imagine Voltron with only 3 robots merging together instead of 5, complete with campy enemy robots/monsters that die with the correct attack from Voltron/Aquarion.",1.0,0,48,7,67,0,0,2995,510,1,0.07732467532467532,0.28888888888888886,60.04,30.53,0.09684371956909929,0.001643562365467785,0.4664284602807925,0.28428013695020377,0.15080412083443662,0.016026711185308847,0.0003337783711615487,1,,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,,long,

That, and the director, Jean Rollin, is of some repute and I'd heard a few good things about it. so I figured why not.  Well, if turned out to be well worth seeing, and easily surpassed my expectations.  The first half of this movie is totally 5 star material, and while it fades quite a bit in the second half, it's still an entertaining, interesting film, which nicely  extends the notions of what a zombie film can be.Lots of people have accussed this movie of being 'slow' and this isn't exactly true.  The horror begins almost immediately, with only 2 brief scenes before Elizabeth and her friend are attacked, and she's alone in the french countryside, which is now populated by inebriated zombies.(well actually, I don't think they have to drink all that much to get infected)  I suppose, however, that, most of the time, not all that much is happening but that doesn't make it 'slow': that's what the movie is about.  This is horror of atmosphere and situation, more than gore or violence horror.(Though it does have some gore)  If you don't like atmospheric horror, you'll probably want to skip this one, but it's definitely good at what it does.  Unlike so many 70's-80's eurohorror films, this film is very low-key.  There is very little music, and it is visually fairly naturalistic visually, avoiding elaborate sets and lurid lighting.(Though it is shot in a fairly elegant manner)  The overall feel of much of the film is rather like 'Night of the Living Dead', although they aren't all that similar in an absolute sense.  It is a rather creepy film, if not out and out scary.(Though I'm almost never really scared by horror films anymore, and that's never really what I was looking for, anyway)  The first horror scene, where Elisabeth watches as a man becomes steadily more infected, and then attacks her is quite effective, as is the initially low-key encounter in the first house she comes across.  The very  best scene in the film is much later however.  One character is grabbed and appears to be being choked by a crazed man/zombie.  Instead of showing us this, however, the camera simply pans over the zombie crowd which is watching with complete passivity.  It's an extraordingarily effective shot.  It's hard to go into specifics, as there isn't much variation from then on, as she and various others just hide and run from the crazed zombie-like townspeople.  The second half loses much of the menace of the first half, and the very final act is kinda weak, but it's strong enough overall to recommend.  There also appears to be some incredibly ham-fisted social commentary late in the film, as two characters talk about fascism and nuclear power and the military which is apparently related to zombies.  This is a fairly jarring scene, but it's also kinda amusing.It is debatable whether or not this truly qualifies as a zombie film.  I think it does, however, though it definitely strays far from the standard conventions a lot of the time.  Here, the infection effects people in different ways- some people are reduced to essentially mindless zombies, whereas others remain fairly lucid much of the time, but with random and uncontrollable murderous impulses.  They're covered with extremely disgusting, if utterly fake looking pustules, many of which are seen to be open and running.  This film has what has got to be the grossest thing I've ever seen in a film: An infected man with a huge sore on his forehead tries to get into a car where Elisabeth is by smashing his forehead against it, rubbing his hideous sore all over it, and covering it with yellow sludge.  There's some gore as well, most notably a spectacularly fake, but quite juicy decapitation and an impalement by pitchfork.This is a quality horror film, and definitely worth a look for anyone who likes atmospheric horror and zombies.",0.75,1,54,9,129,0,0,3997,684,1,0.12497710622710623,0.3458333333333333,56.79,96.18,0.0010723920925065917,0.0010605833105834233,0.0010608038556507084,0.032451691698089265,0.96435452904317,0.013510132599449587,0.00018759379689844922,1,,0.0,0.6,0.75,,long,

Both titles on this dual movie disc -- ""Bank Robbery Collection"" -- are in that category.""The Great Bank Hoax"" is one of the kinder, gentler stories of theft -- and certainly one which an earlier generation will appreciate for the wonderful performances of screen icons such as Burgess Meredith, Richard Baseheart, Ned Beatty, Michael Murphy, Paul Sand and... Arthur Godfrey?  Seems an error in bookkeeping was the design of an ambitious clerk, though that is not known at the time.  Adjustments have to be made to cover the shortfall, and that takes care of the plot.  And what a cover-up it is!  Simply put, you'll love the adventures of these kindly crooks as they scurry to ""fix things"".An old favorite of mine is ""The Great Bank Robbery""; with the unforgettable Zero Mostel as a less than angelic preacher, leading his flock of crooks to the impregnable bank at 'Friendly' -- the bank of the west's ner-do-well's!  Clint Walker is the undercover lawman set to unlock the secrets of the bank, posing as a laundryman, who, by the way, falls for the preacher's stunning 'mistress', played by a vivacious Kim Novak (""I weigh 120 pounds...""  ""..one-hundred twenty-five!"").  Meanwhile the notorious band of banditos (led by Akim Tamiroff and Larry Storch ""Listen to Papa!!"") tries again and again to do things the hard way.  However, it is the escape that ties the whole plot together -- with a balloon chase Captained by the Great Gregory (""Why do they call you 'Great""?"").  Oh yes; there's music as well: Academy Nominated song ""Rainbow Riders"", sung by Zero and flock.Both films look great on the latest 16 X 9 aspect ratio screens and show good color after all these years, along with good sound.  ""Hoax"" was done in 1978 and ""Robbery"" was circa 1969 -- but renewed copyright by the studio has kept the technical criteria up to date.  You can't go to ONE movie these days at the price of this double feature.  Don't miss it.

Summon the Hurricane!,"Shekhar Kapur picks where he left off in telling  the story of Elizabeth Tudor in 1998 by presenting his interpretation of the latter half of the Great Gloriana's reign in this 2007 sequel.It begins in 1585. Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, ""I will not make a window on men's and women's souls"", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whose prediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal ""hurricane that can strip Spain bare"", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter.Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England.Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.",0.5,1,39,6,116,0,0,3869,614,1,0.17294809800128946,0.0,45.32,59.97,0.0016538586416137717,0.001667272539862448,0.017911535056475858,0.9770985395367279,0.0016687942253199872,0.01008012406306539,0.00012919896640826872,1,,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,5.0,long,

That's not to say that the first three seasons weren't, but it was the fourth season that the show went from great to exceptional.  Every episode in this season is a classic, like the episode where Al starts his own shoe hotline, or the one where he tries to buy a new car, but fails when he finds out Peggy stole most of the money he had been hiding.  In my mind, this season is truly some of the all-time best that TV has ever had to offer.The problem lies in the actual DVD releases.  As I'm sure most of you know, there are seven syndicated episodes found in this boxset.  While it may not be the end of the world to miss a minute or so of those episodes, it definitely feels like the people involved in this were too lazy to do the necessary work to get the full versions of these seven episodes.  They offered an explanation to the problem, but I honestly feel that they were being lazy and/or cheap.  Plus the original theme music is once again missing.  I usually fast foward through it anyway, but the new theme music leaves much to be desired.  To top it all off, there is literally no bonus features on this set.I can only hope that all future box sets will include ALL uncut episodes, and that one day they will re-release this boxset with the 7 episodes fixed and totally uncut.  It's only fair to the show and to the fans.  I also hope that they work on getting the original Frank Sinatra theme music back, but this isn't as important.  All in all, I'm thrilled that Married With Children is finally available on DVD, but I really hope that the studios put more time and effort into these boxsets in the future.

And it doesn't help that Donald Trump in numerous interviews keep on saying things that are unbelievably arrogant and not to mention information that are inaccurate (according to him his salary should be the salary of all the Friends cast combined). The series may be addictive and entertaining but it is still in the guilty pleasure realm. In my opinion only The Amazing Race (so far) deserves a separate category in the wealth of reality programs we have right now.********Possible Spoiler**********The concept on paper might be really good, but putting it to life wasn't as successful as it was probably intended at least in terms of quality. Part of the weakness of the concept of the show is the fact that the winner in the show is determined ultimately by Mr. Trump, so even if you win all those tasks, your win is not guaranteed (Aheem  Amy! Ahemm). In an interview Donald Trump said he knew all along that he would pick Bill as the winner. If that was the case then a stretched out whole season series would've been pointless. Another rant is some of the tasks they do on the show, they have nothing to do with the position the candidates are applying for. Are the producers over stretching the concept that selling lemonade is the same as selling insurance policies?Some of the controversial players were the overly enthusiastic Sam, the evil of evils Omarosa, and the classless Heidi (according to Omarosa). Highlights of each episode are the boardroom scenes (Ereka and Nick's one on one was memorable as well as all of Omarosa's dramatics in the boardroom). It's an entertaining series that has its appeal. But do not subscribe to Trump's delusion that this is a smart show that should be watched by those want to be successful in the workplace.

He pulled it off well without digressing from the original Red Green show format. Kudos to the writing. And it was good to see all the normal TV show characters involved. Others give the general plot format so I will not repeat it here.

Jack Wild's performance is too cutesy and a little too much for most older audiences. however Cass is pretty funny and her song is not half bad. Billie Hayes as Witchiepoo is always a hoot.this film has a lot of contemporary appeal for little children who watch ""Yo Gabba' and 'Barney & Friends'. it's probably more elaborate and has better production values than those recent shows.if you're a adult with no children like myself and you actually ordered this...well...let's just say you need to mature and move on.",0.0,1,23,4,54,1,0,1483,256,1,0.15513835263835263,0.0,73.98,50.5,0.062466314107617694,0.0032279085185523628,0.0032204296935007207,0.3239146051611929,0.6071707425191363,0.015509103169251517,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

She loves him but not the lifestyle. She also thinks that he can do better without her so she takes it into her head to run away to Palm Beach to get a quickie divorce. He, on the other hand, is not so fickle. He loves her and does not want to lose her. He takes off chasing after her to stop the divorce. While en route, she is aided by a gentleman who not only turns out to be one of the richest men in the world, he also falls for her. Mr. Rich Guy has a socialite sister who happens to fall for the jilted husband as he tries to woo back his wife. The issue is complicated because the runaway bride lies and says that her husband is in fact her brother. It's a story of guys chasing gals and vice versa with nothing sacred or too serious.This film has some light moments and is evocative of a long past style.

I actually didn't know when I watched this season during its first television run that it would be Michael Rosenbaum's last, and that Kristin Kreuk would only return for five episodes in season eight.  Although I have missed Rosenbaum in the nearly three years since his departure, I have not missed Kreuk as I never really cared for Lana until season six.  While the writer's strike knocked the episode count down from 22 to 20, Smallville fared much better in this respect than many other shows that year.  If I recall correctly, Supernatural's third season only got 16 or 17 episodes.The seventh season of Smallville was great in many respects.  Lex Luthor's continued fall into darkness was epic, culminating in the episode ""Descent,"" where he ruthlessly murdered his own father over the secrets of Veritas and the identity of the mysterious Traveler.  John Glover's presence, just like Annette O'Toole and John Schneider, was sorely missed once he left, but his death scene was quite awesome.  Lex's final (?) confrontation with Clark in the Fortress in ""Arctic"" felt a bit short, leaving me with a ""that's it?"" feeling when it was over.  For all his past dastardly deeds, I enjoyed that Lionel Luthor went down as one of the good guys, albeit one whose methods were still questionable.  I enjoyed how Lionel's need to protect Clark and his secret (even after Jor-El quit using him as a vessel) and his affections for Martha Kent filled Lex with even more bitter resentment toward Clark and Lionel.The growing, yet continually problematic relationship between Chloe and Jimmy was fun to watch.  Allison Mack and Aaron Ashmore had great chemistry, although it was obvious while watching that it would be a relationship that doesn't last.  Even if Jimmy (spoiler alert) didn't die at the end of Season Eight, I still feel like he and Chloe wouldn't have worked out in the long run.  Out of all the seasons Smallville has been on, I feel like Chloe Sullivan has become one of the most dynamic characters, mostly owing to Allison Mack hitting it out of the park time and time again.  Here is a young woman who has sacrificed over and over again for the greater good: her feelings for Clark, often her friendship with Clark, her relationship with Jimmy, her job at the Daily Planet, her freedom, sometimes her sanity all in the name of protecting the super heroes.Lois was fun to watch this season, and for the first time I actually felt like Erica Durance was growing into the role of Lois Lane.  Her relationship this season with Grant Gabriel was a nice twist.  Kara Kent (Supergirl) did not make that much of an impression on me, either way.  I liked her episodes in the second half of the season much better than the first half.  Given that she was only a series regular for one season I do not fault Laura Vandervoot for this.Finally, I was supremely happy that the Clark/Lana storyline came to a close, despite a brief return in Season Eight.  This set the stage for Clark to fall in love with Lois.  After years and years of watching Lana fall for other people, reject him for other men (Jason, Lex), I found it annoying that Clark continued to indulge Lana.  I mean, given her turn to the dark side in season six, is it really plausible that Clark would still believe Lana incapable of any deception at all?  He's had no problems calling Chloe out when she lied to him (mostly seasons eight and nine, and even then Chloe lied only to protect Clark or the other super heroes).  After season six, I also found it unbelievable that Lana would just jump into playing house with Clark on the Kent farm.  Lana's exit from the series via videotape also seemed dumb, and while I'm not a big Lana fan I am glad Kristin Kreuk returned for just the five episodes in Season Eight to wrap up her character and storyline.",0.0,0,31,7,101,3,0,3969,699,1,0.15899216524216525,0.65,63.93,115.13,0.001231402034725418,0.0012387920932069472,0.6721343454378679,0.20716874229349067,0.11822671814070902,0.00781053162005543,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

She liked the story and persuaded the studio to make it.  Princess Beatrix (Jessie Royce Landis) is a domineering mother of an erstwhile royal family, ousted from the throne in the past by Napoleon, whose name she forbids the use of in her house.Prince Albert (Alec Guinness), her cousin, and the current crown prince, is coming to visit the household for a few days.  The queen, his mother, Queen Maria Dominika (Agnes Moorehead), will join him shortly.  Princess Beatrix has designs on Albert marrying her daughter, Princess Alexandra (Grace Kelly), in order to restore the family to the throne when Albert gets the crown.But there is a thorn in Beatrix's plan.  The tutor to her two small sons and Alexandra, in fencing, Dr. Nicholas Agi (Louis Jourdan), although considered to be low class and below consideration by Beatrix (and therefor also by Alexandra) is in love with Alexandra.  Albert is cool to Alexandra, and Beatrix tries to get him interested by engineering a triangle, using Nicholas.  It backfires, and therein lies the story.It sound, in the telling, like a soap opera, but as played--because of the skill of the actors and the direction--it is a compelling drama.

Good God this is one of the best bad movies ever. It begins with this scientist that looks like Rasputin the Mad Monk, digging around in a cavern. A zombie, that looks alot like a rotten potato with a side of earthworms and nightcrawlers, just sort of appears, and the scientist is like, ""Wait, I'm your friend."" This gripping, horrifying scene sets the tone for the whole movie.What you have is a group of people, drawn together for reasons absolutely unknown, to a villa. Then, it's a matter if seeing if they can stop fornicating long enough to get up and run from the zombies. The zombies all look like potatoes garnished with worms. They have crooked, oversized teeth, wear burlap sacks, and they stagger around like they've been drinking turpentine cocktails. Why are they here? Who knows? Do the zombies know? Let's ask...Zombie: ...Okay, I guess not. At one point, a woman runs from a zombie and steps into a steel-toothed bear trap set in the courtyard for no apparent reason, and she complains about the PAIN, the PAIN, oh God the PAIN, until the end of the movie. At one point, one of the couples is cavorting beside a flower bed, and like, there's a zombie buried in there too. Here's a key scene: The slouch that owns the villa, or whatever, sends the MAID to go secure the grounds. She reaches out of a window to close a shutter, and one of the zombies, with maybe one good eye obscured by worms, is adept enough to knife-toss a railroad spike, pinning the maid's hand to the shutter. Mmm hmm, yeah. I won't even go into one of the disturbing relationships that takes place among two of the people trapped in the villa. Trust me, after that one you'll be ready to see the rotten potato zombies again.The ""Nights of Terror"" only turns out to be one night of terror, after which the last scatter of survivors hotfoots it enlist the aid of a local group of monks that just happen to be potato-and-worm zombies too, baby! But, the zombies have shown themselves to be skilled at railroad spike throwing, scythe beheading, and basic carpentry. The movie ends with the zombies trying to shove a guy's face into a table saw.

But very quickly after the main pivot point in the plot, the film spirals off into leftist paranoia and clumsy editorializing. A feeble  attempt at relevance has the reverse effect of turning the film trite and cliched. The villains that might have been interesting, had they been presented with any depth, became cartoonish stereotypes, and the plot became increasingly ludicrous and muddled with the result that any admiration for the craft involved was completely subsumed by this simplistic and trivial sermonizing.Too bad, because I like Mark Wahlburg and Fuqua has shown he has good chops in the action genre and can present complex characters ala Training Day.  But if I needed another pretentious misrepresentation of facts, I need only access any number of mainstream media.  No doubt there is a vast audience that will either ignore the op-ed message in the film or will eat-it-up.  Sorry, I'm not interested in lame caricatures and simplistic conventional wisdom.  Maybe 1/2 more star  solely for the quality of the film-making despite the content.  It's not a horrible film, having some good moments before it descends into utter silliness.

Why the chains?","This is a 2 person review... the reactions of 2 viewers, #1 and #2.#1 -  Look, this movie was exciting.  You end up wanting to know more about this world, how these vampires and lycons interact with ""normal"" folk like me, and certainly, what happens AFTER the events in this movie.  The action is great, the acting is not too shabby (look tired and thin, but ready for action), and the sets really are interesting, even with the hanging chains and dripping ceilings.  But why are the werewolves called lycon?#2 -  OK, so you don't know where ""lycon"" came from.  According to Wikipedia, ""Lycon can refer to one of two persons.  First, in Greek mythology, Lycon was a son of King Hippocoon of Sparta... Second, a fellow by the name of Lycon was involved in the trial of Socrates, and acted as one of the three prosecuters.""  Where they got attached to werewolves I don't know. Perhaps from Lycon pictus, the African wild hunting dog?  Is lykos Greek for ""wolf""?#1 - You're insane.#2 - Hey, I would have used the term werewolf.  Now what about this movie?#1 - It is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action.  I don't know what all the chains hanging from the ceilings were for... mood, I guess.  This is the 4th time I've watched this film, and it gets better each time.  You pick up something new each time you watch it.#2 - Appropriate age range and rating... PG-13?#1 - No, I'd say it is a R-rated movie, for all the violence.#2 - The ending makes me interested in seeing the sequel, Underworld Evolution.#1 - I agree, but I think it is a 4 star movie.#2 - Tough, I'm the one typing.#1 - You're lucky it's not a full moon...#2 - So why did you give it 4 stars?#1 - Because you gave it 3, and I am looking for a meal...",0.0,12,60,10,117,6,0,1727,319,1,0.16103771707219983,0.1,86.1,91.78,0.0024948803106790442,0.0025233643417052884,0.08639030438743958,0.002510824485340127,0.906080626474836,0.03474232773595831,0.0,3,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,long,

It's understandable as to why the demand is high for this film but I'll talk more about that later. After searching everywhere for this movie, I finally found it in its entirety on Youtube and treated myself to a nice watch.The plot of the film surrounds 3 brothers Casey, Geoffrey, and Randy. It's a few weeks before Halloween and the carnival is in town. Casey refuses to go because he has an extreme phobia of clowns after an incident with a clown at the previous year's carnival and occasionally has nightmares about them. Geoffery is typically understanding of Casey's fear, while Randy tends to be more of a jerk and make fun of Casey about his fear. After working up the nerve to go with his brothers to the carnival, he's picked by a clown to be a part of the show, but he runs off in fear with the audience laughing at him.Later that night when the carnival is over, the 3 original clowns are attacked and killed by a couple of murderous psychopaths who escaped from a mental institution earlier that day. The escaped patients disguise themselves at circus clowns and go out on the loose.Unfortunately for the 3 brothers, the 3 psychotic clowns just so happen to stumble into their yard. While staying up late watching a scary movie, the power to the house is cut and that's all it takes for the terror to begin. The clowns invade the house and the brothers are immediately thrown into a deadly cat and mouse game, fighting for survival. The local shop is closed for the night, mom won't be back until late, and Officer Friendly thinks Casey's phone call is bogus and the clowns he's seeing are all a part of his imagination. Casey then realizes he must face his greatest fear or die trying. Will Casey, Randy, and Geoffrey last through the night and kill these demented clowns, or will they all fall to Casey's worst nightmare come true?Overall: After finally finding this film in its entirety on Youtube and being able to watch it beginning to end, this will now be added to my favorite horror Clown movies list. The plot is good for it's time which was 1988 but the movie itself lacks background information on the characters of this film as well as any character development. It just jumps right in with the plot and it takes off from there. My only dislike about this movie is the ending as it's pretty bland that lacks creativity and leaves viewers with a few questions that are left unanswered.I'd recommend buying this movie but because of the high demand, you're better off watching it on Youtube...unless you must have the physical format and are willing to sacrifice money, anywhere from $50.00-$300.000. The reason this film is OOP and at a high demand is because the director of the film, Victor Salva, was charged with sexual abuse in 1988 of 12 year old Nathan Forrest Winters, who plays the lead character, Casey. In 2004, following MGM's DVD release of the film, the controversy surrounding the sex abuse charges arose again and a dispute over the rights to the movie began. Due to this, MGM discontinued selling copies of the movie and has since gone OOP. Now the few people who own this movie put it up for grabs on Ebay and Amazon at a very high price due to its rarity.All in all, Clownhouse is a pretty good clown horror film. Just don't go into it expecting any background character information or a decent ending. As another reviewer said, it's a tainted 80s gem. Clownhouse will always be a rare but classic movie to watch, but not without the disgusting controversy surrounding it",0.0,0,50,10,86,1,0,3631,648,1,0.06970079365079367,0.16666666666666666,66.47,78.25,0.16882748980122628,0.0013587602246727078,0.0013485030034636847,0.2453263240502255,0.5831389229204118,0.013770311209033324,0.0,2,,0.0395712,0.0,0.0,,long,

The rest is pure speculation.When approaching the screenplay for 1995's ROB ROY, it would appear that writer Alan Sharp took a great deal of liberty with all versions of the Rob Roy legend and invented characters and scenarios in order to tell a story that would make an engaging film.Well,so we have it;a very drawn out folk legend that has the most interesting character in the whole bloody script,Archibald Cunningham,aptly and cunningly portrayed by a smarmyTim Roth, who is a  completely fictional foe to help romanticize the fact that one of Macgregor's cattlemen, in fact, made off with Macgregor's borrowed 1000 pounds.Cunningham even brutally rapes Macgregor's wife, Mary,(Jessica Lange.....what is going on with her face??)in order to make Macgregor even more determined to have vengeance and clear his name.This is a film about honor and an attempt to tell a story which many will believe as a faithful and true account of Rob Roy's life.Be that as it may, it is just a film and a handsome one at that,with smart and innovative editing by Peter Honess and a terrific  ""highlander"" score by veteran Carter Burwell.The story?....aye, well there is my rub...does Alan Sharp want to tell a story of revenge or a love story? Also ,Sharp makes so few and precious references to ""the Jacobites"",""the Calvinists"" and ""the Stuarts"" that one really must know history well in order to factor in the importance of these historical references to his script.The fact that Sharp totally invents the character of Cunningham in order to make Macgregor a more sympathetic character than the ""outlaw/Robin Hood"" rogue that history makes him to be seems dishonest.I am of UK decent, so don't chide me as being unsympathetic...it's just that when history says one thing and a film says another,I am,in this case (not always) siding more with historical fact( what little is actually known to be true.It is significant to note that in Dafoe's account of Rob Roy,he wrote it in order to clear Rob's name before King George 1, so there is no telling how much fiction there was.Scott fleshed out his account 100 years later!).I personally just did not like the script,not solely because  most of it is fiction,but rather it was not engaging or focused enough  despite beautiful shots of the highlands and superb acting by Tim Roth (playing a character that he  plays again in 2000's VATEL).I love huge period piece film generally,but 3 stars for this big budget,flashy and long  fictional movie is as high as I go.",0.6666666666666666,1,88,13,91,4,1,2703,453,1,0.19504803675856308,0.11666666666666665,55.78,49.82,0.0017215236269649465,0.001711078206654001,0.0016976384191420579,0.8290788592410984,0.16579090050614062,0.032556418793932666,0.0002465483234714004,2,5.0,0.0063072,0.5,0.6666666666666666,4.0,long,

The production values are very good, the menu system works well, and the content is excellent. While the animations are primarily digitally enhanced and morphed video image collages as opposed to full 3D rendered stories, the style and quality of execution are superb.There are two main themes presented; one primarily of enhanced images, while the other is more like exotic title sequences for films. Some are blends of both. The video images are colored and modified, overlayed with nice animations of glowing lights, geometric patterns, particle fountains, and gorgeously morphed into other images. All kinds of title effects are used with exotic lettering that may or may not be real language. (It's beautiful, who cares?) There is also a menu of looping cuts out of the different pieces.I was also impressed with the music. It is a nice world music - new age kind of blend, and it fits the video quite well. Traditional instruments and beautiful voicework mix well with some electronic influences. I use it for meditation, and have ordered the CD to save wear and tear on the DVD.All in all, it lives up to the name, and the concept of video Illuminated Manuscripts shines through admirably. It is a relaxing and satisfying bit of eye candy and more. Having worked with video and computer graphics for nearly 20 years, I can say that few works reach this level.

William Hurt plays the President of the United States in a time of Global Terror.  He attends a conference in Spain and is shot.  Dennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service Agent who is brought back for this event after being shot and nearly losing his life a year earlier.The first half of the movie shows us the event, rewinds and shows us events from another person's point of view, and does that four times (as I recall).  After that we think we have the pieces together and the movie tells its narratives as some of the previous views converge for different reasons.  I really don't want to say any more about the plot.I thought it was a pretty good and entertaining movie.  Quaid gives a solid performance as a serious, brave, but understandably tentative agent.  William Hurt is good in his smallish role.  Forest Whitaker gives the movie an emotional center.

Sure, this and Wolverine are not quite as good, but they are definitely in the same league.Beyond a wonderful story, the greatest fun of this film is to see the relationships between the early characters, many of whom become the deadliest of adversaries 30 years or so later.  I was surprised to learn that Xavier and Mystique essentially grew up together, she as an adopted and beloved sister who wanted him to become her husband; after his rejection, she almost got together with Hank, then ultimately chose Magneto when he insisted she appear as her natural self.  Meanwhile, the background and character of Magneto are fully developed, from his incarceration as a Jew in Hitler's Germany to his enlistment by a mysterious psychopath as played to perfection by Kevin Bacon.  Once he mastered his powers with Xavier's help, Magneto comes to treat others as he himself was treated.  Finally, the relationship - like warring but loving brothers - between Xavier and Magneto, representing the two poles that the mutant community must choose.  It is superbly acted, mostly by relative unknowns.  I hope that this will spawn its own series.The plot is also very engaging.  Placing the mutants smack in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis, we learn the hidden history behind not just its inception, but its resolution and the terrible dangers that were avoided are great imaginative reconstructions.  There are also some great new characters with unusual powers.Yep, this will have to be added to our collection.

It's a recollection of her, told mostly by her mother with some interview clips thrown in of others involved with her and a mixture of actual footage of events of the war, and &#34;faux&#34; footage (reinactment made to look like old footage).It is a surprising story to me in that she became such a huge, honored symbol (for lack of better words).  She was a Jewish girl from a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary.  She was a smart girl, well liked by her classmates as they elected her to office in school - however antisemitism had crept in to the school (where Jews had to pay 3x higher admission) and the school reheld the election to have a non-Jew elected. . . . This was the start of her &#34;wake-up call&#34; and her interest in school went downhill and her interest in moving to Palestine grew.  So, she got herself accepted to an agricultural school in Palestine.  hardly what you'd expect a smart and well-off girl to do, but she figured there were enough smart people - Palestine needed more workers.  A little odd, but...In Palestine, she was &#34;safe&#34; from the German war atrocities against the Jews, and as it turned out Budapest was still unoccupied - a final holdout for the Jews, but she saw the writing on the wall and knew she HAD to get her mother out, and anyone else she could -- now.  So she joined a group and trained to parachute into Hungary and they were going to start getting Jews out and strengthening resistance efforts, etc.  They arrived too late. They parachuted in days outside of Budapest and the Germans invaded within a few days of their landing. They were unable to do anything.She got caught before she could help even 1 person..  So in a sense, she didn't accomplish anything and you wonder why she ended up being so famous, so revered. ....  She had key information the Germans wanted and took her punishments instead of turning over the info.  Somehow within the prison where she was being held she became loved and revered, but this didn't really explain why to my satisfaction.  I guess she was a shining example of holding out a flicker of light to those who were desperately seeking one in the darkness of the times.....It was interesting, not at all what I expected... and while she seems to be someone to admire for her strength and courage, she did have an &#34;out&#34; -- she could've saved herself (so this show says) knowing that the city was being liberated and it was only a matter of a few days....  I didn't really understand why she chose to bravely go down at that point.  I think I missed something.  I'm thinking there were MANY people who were the strong flickers of light during those times, in many places --- how SHE in particular became so famous/special for it I still don't know.If you just love every chunk of info about the Jews and WWII and stuff, you might want to see this . . . but for me, it was interesting but I almost feel like I wasted my time on this.

Samson Gaul (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is the village butcher who moonlights as a mercenary. His accent varies throughout the film. His son (Kristopher Van Varenberg) who works at the US embassy, sends him clients.When Andrew Fayden(Joe Flanigan), an American cage fighter's  daughter Becky (Charlotte Beaumont) is kidnapped, he calls on Samson who is reluctant to take the case. On his last case he generated a significant amount of collateral damage that wasn't as funny as when MacGruber does it.The movie has a slight twist which really wasn't much of a twist. Monica Fayden (Anna-Louise Plowman) mouthing statistics in the middle of the film made me think this was a 93 minute public service announcement. In addition to beating up people, Samson uses elaborate high tech stuff. He is capable of setting up complex traps in a matter of moments.

Part 1,"We are now at the apex of the COMBAT series when the show reached its' peak as this season has the best episode ever produced. There are a few episodes that seem variations on previous Combat themes, but overall the fourth season holds up well...Of the cast members, Jack Hogan as Kirby does his best work in three pivotal episodes, especially in Hills are for Heroes which I consider one of the greatest war movies ever made. I will discuss this episode in the COMBAT SEASON 4 CONFLICT 2 review. For now, here are some of the hits and misses of season 4...1. The Leader - Kirby must lead a group of disgruntled soldiers as they prepare for a German counterattack....one of the shows where Jack Hogan shines...2. Retribution - Jack Hogan is 2 for 2 as Kirby, when he discovers that his future Brother-in-law was beaten to death by a sadistic German Officer. Hogan's acting is top notch as he seeks revenge.3. The Raider - a tense drama as Saunders needs to discover which of the German prisoners is actually the Officer who knows the whereabouts of a captured Hanley.4. Finest Hour -  It is a treat to see the fine French actress Luise Rainer in a morality play regarding honor and sacrifice.5. Main Event - Jack Carter plays the manager of  contending boxer and tries to protect his ""investment"" from the dangers of war. Jack Carter is at his conniving and sleazy best.6. The Old Men -  Simon Oakland portrays an replacement with bad knees, as he and other older replacements join Saunders squad.7.The First Day - Four ""Green"" soldiers are put in Saunders squad. If this seems familiar to THE OLD MEN, well, I guess it is, but it is still well done.Those are a few of the fine episodes which are included in this season 4 compilation of COMBAT. There are however some, not so stellar episodes.1. The Linesman -  Jack Lord is a know it all radioman who accompanies Saunders squad on a mission. It is the overdone  ""Arrogant Officer Humbled"" theme.2. Hear No Evil -  There are actually good portions of this episode where Saunders loses his hearing. The scene which illustrates how he became deaf is well done. There is a silly section involving a dog however which brings the episode down, and if you are a dog lover, you may become unsettled.3. The Farmer - Dennis Weaver loves animals more than Humans. Just plain dumb.So, should you buy this set?  Yes, most certainly, for there is much to enjoy in this collection. If you are planning to buy both volumes of this season 4 DVD set, but are only planning to buy one at this time, then I advise you save buying SEASON 4 CONFLICT 1 for now and quickly purchase SEASON 4 CONFLICT 2 because, as I mentioned previously, one of the finest war movies was produced when HILLS ARE FOR HEROES hit the small screen.

It is sooo much better then mismatched stock footage insertions),and the use of excellent and interesting actors. Here we have a young pre-Sir John Guilguld, as well as a young Peter Lorre in his second role for Hitchcock (having just flown in from America after doing the remake of the Hands of Dr. Orlac in Hollywood), to play a cartoon skirt chasing mustachioed Mexican contract killer working for the government character...really. Presumably, this time Lorre understood the actual meaning of his script, (unlike two years earlier in The Man Who Knew Too Much). Dialogue is weak and a major flaw of the movie.  A must for both Lorre fans, and Hitchcock fans.I remain, frustrated from waiting for an American DVD copy of Young and Innocent with the full 90 minutes. The American copy had two Una O'Conner scenes removed, for a total of a 1/9th shortening of the movie.

Let the Right One is a perfect film. It's beautifully shot, has a great story and fantastic performances from its two lead actors Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. It moves at a somewhat deliberate pace in comparison to your average American horror film, but you will still find yourself engrossed. It's probably one of the best vampire stories I have ever seen, whittling the mythos down to the barest of essentials as well as giving a new twist on the 'rules' (what happens if a vampire enters a dwelling that it was not invited to?). The word 'vampire' is only mentioned once in the entire film. If you're looking for a straight-up horror film you will likely be disappointed, as the film is not particularly scary; the focus is largely on the relationship between the two kids with much of the horrific content happening sporadically. It is however a very haunting and moving experience that you won't soon forget.The only real criticism I can give it is, as an adaptation of the original book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who writes the screenplay), it drops the ball on some plot points. In particular, there is one jarring shot that will likely confuse some viewers if they don't know its proper context. Granted, many have been able to pick up on what it means, but there's still a chance that you will be left in the dark. That being said, worse case scenario is that you end up reading the book to understand the film better, which you should either way. Lindqvist still delivers a pitch-perfect script on every other level.That being said, I would recommend fans import the UK Blu-ray disc from Amazon.co.uk over the US disc. It's region-free, so it will work on any US player. The biggest plus is that it comes with an exclusive commentary track from Lindqvist and director Tomas Alfredson that the Magnolia disc lacks. In addition, it's guaranteed to have the proper subtitles, whereas there's a chance one might still stumble upon an earlier version of the US disc that has the poorly translated ones. Both versions have the deleted scenes, although they're presented in HD with the UK disc and SD in the US disc. If features don't matter to you, the US disc still delivers the film in a high quality presentation in terms of picture and audio, but fans will gain more from the international release.",1.0,0,92,17,65,2,0,2363,413,1,0.1296788396788397,0.16666666666666666,67.38,62.68,0.4463846990906062,0.001665416975407739,0.001666792028542554,0.3000000189487865,0.2502830729566571,0.03893355903512484,0.00042301184433164127,1,,0.0,0.75,0.0,5.0,long,

Science fiction fans will not be impressed with the average repetitive special effects, but it does prove to be a good thrill ride.  Del Spooner (Will Smith) is distrustful of robots and you find out why later, although according to the three `rules', no robot can ever hurt a human being.  The plot is simple, but has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained.  The car race scenes are exciting (only in that Del Spooner takes on an army of robots), if not somewhat unbelievable.  The special effects are reminiscent of ""Tron"", which proves that Hollywood could have done a lot better.  In any event, the ending wraps things up nicely and proves that it might not be the end of the world and there are good robots and bad robots - just like people.

Everyone in this film has them, but the question is, do they ever come true? Do you have to put that dream on hold because of other circumstances beyond your control, until it consumes you to do something unthinkable? Or in order to reach that dream you want to come true so badly, you decide to take another route to get it? Or you just let it die, and you are forever regretting not taking the necessary steps to make that dreams a reality?I first saw this on television umpteen years ago and in school, and I was touched by the whole plot. In the 1950s, an African-American family living in a Chicago tenement obtains a large amount of money from an insurance policy due to the death of the patriarch, and his widow (Claudia McNeil) decides to use a large portion of it as a down payment on a home in the suburbs, which is a thrill to everyone in the family, except her petulant son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier). Walter Lee has dreams of his own, and wants the insurance money for another purpose.Walter Lee's headstrong, witty and socially conscious younger sister, Beneatha (Diana Sands), is a college student who has dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor and in the meanwhile, trying desperately to identify with her African roots after meeting a Nigerian exchange student (Ivan Dixon). This is a major ingredient in the script, being that this was written shortly after the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, several years before the Black Panthers were formed and at least 15 years before the women's liberation movement. Will she ever get there? Meanwhile, Walter Lee and his mother continuously clash until his mother finally breaks down and gives him a portion of the money, but she is very careful about how she wants him to use it.Meanwhile, the residents of the white suburban neighborhood where this family wants to move don't want them there. Later on, a decision must be made. Should they move to this beautiful new home where they aren't really wanted, or take the white neighbors up on their offer to buy the house back from them with a profit?The entire cast, which is the original Broadway ensemble, is stellar, especially Claudia McNeil's amazing portrayal of the widowed Lena Younger, Walter Lee's mother. She is nothing short of phenomenal - she is a proud woman, a tower of strength in the face of tragedy and although she herself is suffering, she is able to put her own grief aside to comfort the other family members. This is clearly Sidney Poitier's finest role, right up there with playing Virgil Tibbs in 1967's ""In The Heat of the Night"". Exploding with intensity, he accurately nails down the frustrations and pain of a black man who wants for much more for himself and his family, and pins his hopes on an unyielding dream. Ruby Dee plays Ruth, Walter Lee's wife, a beautiful woman of quiet dignity who is struggling with conflicts of her own. Also appearing in his first movie role is future Oscar winner Louis Gossett, Jr. as George Murchison, an articulate and well-to-do college student.This is still a relevant  topic today, even though this film was made over 40 years ago because these  things are still happening. Lorraine Hansberry, the playwright, was inspired to write this masterpiece by her own experience of moving to an all-white Chicago suburb as a child, and the very public genrification story of entertainer Nat King  Cole, who faced the same kind of bigotry when he brought a house in  a wealthy white neighborhood in California in 1948.Wonderful family  film.

(This isn't to say I don't enjoy it when it's obviously necessary, but I digress ...)  Some actors show great promise when they're young, and, as they age, they're rewarded with material that, sadly, might be beneath them and their skills.  In other instances, the material may be so horribly written that it's hard to accept any measure of theatrical skill could've saved it.  However, in some noticeable cases, an actor is blessed with the reputation of a master thespian despite the fact that no series of performances warrants the praise.  I tend to think Shia LaBeouf falls into this last category - it's not to imply he's untalented but rather to say I've only seen middling performances (at best) from the man - and LAWLESS puts him in yet another picture that possibly may've benefitted from some fresh blood as a leading man instead of an established box office name.  (So sue me!)(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Prohibition is the law of the land, and, in Franklyn County, Virginia, nobody was as `lawless' (see how that works?) as the Bondurant brothers: Forrest (played by Tom Hardy), Howard (rising star Jason Clarke), and Jack (LaBeouf).  In 1931, when the law started catching up with bootleggers if for no other purpose than to get a piece of their action, it was the Bondurants who held out against the corrupt system, preferring to keep their business (and their earnings) to themselves.  This is no small way helped turn Franklyn into the wettest county in the world (the very name of the book upon which this screenplay was based).  When crooked officers tried to shut them down, the brothers fought back, tooth and nail.As for the rest of the story?Meh.  It's all a bit nebulous as incidents that may've been based on real history play out more like structured character `beats' than they do a comfortable narrative.  Jack is the runt of the litter - he's clearly only half as rough and rugged as his brothers Howard and Forrest (both are rumored to be indestructible if not immortal by locals), and he takes the brunt of it when Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce in a weird turn of face) comes down hard on the family.  He's beaten and kicked around solidly for much of the film, so it only stands to reason that, come the conclusion, he'd go all `Billy Jack' on the lawman.  While that may be based on a true account of the affair, it ends up feeling mostly manufactured here.Also, it didn't help matters that LaBeouf ended up being shackled with a hackneyed Southern accent.  He does the best he can with the lines, but, having seen him in so many big budget productions, so much of his dialect here sounded really inauthentic in the bad-community-theatre kind of way.  Hardy was able to pull it off mostly because he had so little to say (Clarke similarly only had a handful of scenes of extended dialogue).  Again, it's a middling performance not all that believable based on circumstances, which is why I said in the onset that I don't want to feel as though I'm piling on LaBeouf given the fact that he's appeared in two out of three TRANSFORMERS films that were pretty awful as well as almost single-handedly destroying every good memory I have of an INDIANA JONES motion picture.Again, if my bias is showing, you'll have to forgive me.  Like most of you, I take my fascination with flicks very seriously - serious enough to write about them increasingly online - and I try hard to not be prejudiced with acting talent.  I think LaBeouf's a diamond-in-the-rough probably a few years more in the making; I think he was wrong for this movie; but I don't hate his work.Jessica Chastain makes a nice turn here as Maggie Beauford, a Chicago dancer who self-deported to Virginia for quieter spaces.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to secondary status here.  I would've loved to have seen more of her, but, alas, the story as scripted simply didn't allow for it.Lastly, let me make a plug here for more films of this nature (those based on historical events).  In particular, I've always been fascinated with America's greatest failed social experiment, Prohibition.  I've read plenty of books on the subject - it fascinates me - and LAWLESS does an admirable job showing us today what it was like `back in the day.'  It these elements I wish we were shown more of - a miniseries much like the recent HATFIELDS AND MCCOYS would be stellar, and even the dry (pardon the pun) PBS documentary PROHIBITION (thank you, Ken Burns) comes to mind - I think LAWLESS would've had a chance at finding a bigger audience.LAWLESS is produced by Benaroya Pictures, FilmNation Entertainment, Annapurna Pictures, Blum Hanson Allen Films, Pie Films Inc., Red Wagon Productions, and Yucaipa Films.  DVD distribution appears to have been handled through Anchor Bay.  As for the technical specifications, this is a big Hollywood production; as such, it all looks and sounds pretty solid, except for a few of Hardy's lines which were (I believe) deliberately hard to understand as his character tended to be fairly soft-spoken as well as a man of few words.RECOMMENDED.  Knowing what I know of Prohibition, I'd suspect that there's an awful lot more to this story than what was delivered.  At best, the script services the need to tell a story - it sets up each of these characters with the barest of bones, presents a catalyst for drama, and then delivers said climax with albeit predictable results - but I can't help but wonder what more there is to the story that couldn't fit inside the traditional two-hour package.  LaBeouf continues to get starring roles despite his lack of presence - I'd have spent more time with Hardy's underplayed (and underexplored) Forrest Bondurant and Clarke's Howard Bondurant; his character seemed so circumstantial here, that I'm not sure what more he could've added with his limited and overrated skills, but it is what it is.",0.0,0,64,8,230,2,1,6253,1077,1,0.07273193760262725,-0.07777777777777779,62.01,37.98,0.03493951073768453,0.0007696018324229871,0.000778710013496954,0.4956877695352375,0.46782440788115814,0.010235087158164081,0.0,4,3.6666666666666665,0.274752,0.0,0.0,3.0,long,

The movie is bloody, very violent, and filled with both male and female nudity, but it's involving--and more suspenseful rather than being overly disturbing. My one complaint is that the ending is too hastily resolved, and we never find out what happens to the Bronson character afterwards. However, this is a great movie, not only well made (as Siskel pointed out) but also very engrossing. I wish we had more Bronson offerings like this, but maybe I just haven't found all of them yet. Definitely a keeper.The MGM DVD presentation is very good, short on extras of any kind, but the picture is good, and the film uncut.

This reviewer tends to shun works whose hallmarks are teen angst and cleverness for its own sake.  Pleasantville, however, despite rolling in cleverness, manages to transcend its cleverness and its teen-angst focus, and exudes genuine charm and something of a soul.  This is due partly to the excellent performances, partly to the sharp production that includes a wonderful original score by Randy Newman (yup, another one) incorporating iconic music of the 1950s, and partly to the fact that the film's clear point of view isn't heavy-handed.David Wagner (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high-schooler in the 1990s whose cheerless home, divorced parents, depressed mother, and contemptuous, slutty sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), have left him susceptible to the wistful charms of a 1950s black and white TV sitcom about one of those always and effortlessly Happy Families.  The show, Pleasantville, features two siblings named Bud and Mary Sue who are about David's and Jennifer's ages.  David is so addicted to this sitcom that, as the film opens, he is preparing to watch a weekend marathon of the show, and to compete in a contest among devotees to see who can remember the most details from the entire history of the program.Just as David sits down to the beginning of the marathon, Jennifer appears and claims TV rights: she had planned to watch a rock concert that evening in the company of the school's most notorious stud, who she plans to seduce.  David and Jennifer begin to struggle over the TV remote and break it, apparently rendering the issue moot.  However, David's acute longing for the tranquillity and happiness portrayed in Pleasantville attracts the notice of a mysterious TV ""repairman"" (Don Knotts) who suddenly appears on the doorstep with a new ""remote"".  The struggle for control of the TV is reignited, but this time, as David and Jennifer tug at the remote, they push a button that draws them through the television set and into the world of Pleasantville, which was on as they fought.In an eyeblink, David and Jennifer Wagner find themselves cast in the roles of Bud and Mary Sue Parker, complete with era-appropriate clothing (""five pounds of underwear"" Jennifer hisses, tugging at the pointy, underwire bra, girdle, slip, and stockings under the poodle skirt, demure blouse, and sweater she finds herself wearing).  The two have been transported from the splashy, morally freewheeling, noisy technicolor world of the 1990s into the black-and-white, serene, orderly world of Pleasantville.  Mom and Dad (marvellously rendered without a trace of  irony by Joan Allen and William H. Macy) never quarrel; meals are fulsome and on time; everyone eats together at the table; the basketball team always wins its games; the weather is always perfect.Guided by David's knowledge of the show, he and Jennifer cautiously begin navigating their new world as they try to figure out how to get home.  Inevitably, the mores of David and Jennifer begin to impact the world of Pleasantville - and vice versa.  And that last factor is the one that saves the film from predictability.  David, initially more comfortable with and accepting of the limitations of Pleasantville, wants to get home without disturbing this cultural environment, to which he at first applies a sort of hands-off Prime Directive.  Jennifer, on the other hand, initially despises her role as Mary Sue, is bored witless, and sets out to make mischief as soon as she can, starting with a heavy makeout session in Lover's Lane with the captain of the basketball team.  As Jennifer introduces the disturbance of sex into the equilibrium of Pleasantville, the effect ripples out, and the mature inhabitants of the town are startled to see their enviroment shifting into . . . color.  Of course, with the splotches of color (a red rose, a green sportscar, a tight red sweater, pink and green bathroom tiles. . .) come shifts in behavior and outlook, mostly concentrated among the young high school crowd.It looks as if David and Jennifer are the ones effecting change, but eventually it becomes clear that they are also being changed.  David finds himself, surprisingly, rebelling against the limitations of Pleasantville, and uncovers a decidedly non-nerdy core.  Jennifer, on the other hand, finds that the town slut role has become rather old, and in the persona of the studious Mary Sue, uncovers a surprising new direction.  By the time David and Jennifer find the way home, they have more or less switched ""sides"" where Pleasantville is concerned - of course, it's the new, full-color Pleasantville, but. . .The filmmakers are not shy about their central viewpoint that it really isn't possible to repress the essential self, and that the dangers of freedom and self-expression are worth its rewards.  Nevertheless, film also points up aspects of modern culture that can make a place like Pleasantville look so attractive.  Nicely written and produced, Pleasantville works very well as pure fantasy, as well as allegory.  This reviewer has watched the film several times with great pleasure.  Tobey Maguire's endearing performance as the quirky David is the core of the film, but he is ably supported by Reese Witherspoon's wicked Jennifer, who is not nearly as dumb as she pretends, and some surprisingly moving moments from Joan Allen and William H. Macy as Mom and Dad Parker.You will find the film's double bulls-eye most apparent in the number of people who wish David and Jennifer had left well enough alone in Pleasantville.",1.0,0,22,3,175,0,0,5595,913,1,0.18236492358651446,0.5,52.94,9.21,0.09280636534663658,0.0010670378767197437,0.0010703458485030798,0.9039973519850601,0.001058898943080356,0.003932082216264522,0.00017869907076483203,2,4.0,0.0133056,0.5,0.0,4.5,long,

(not in the LACKING intelligence, but the ANTI-intelligence sense of the word.) but you realize it's actually faultless, even quite astute, when you stop and think about what it's trying to do. after all, the Stone Age is hardly the proper setting for, say, ""The Importance Of Being Earnest."" and it's hardly Shakespeare, but when it tells the story of people who have yet to fully develop the English language, just how Shakespearean can you realistically expect it to be? and the general theme (several themes, in fact) are things we've all seen before, but so what? wouldn't be the first thing people needed to be reminded of, now would it?in a rough, unforgiving world where only the strong prosper, the Neanderthal equivalant of an elitist tribe expells two members. first, Dennis Quaid because he becomes injured, then Ringo Starr because he can't contain his infatuation (or should i say lust) for the leader's woman. a happy accident enabling them to stand erect is only the beginning of their journey into the development of civilization.it turns out that their former tribe has certain Aryan attitudes, because the other misfits they encounter include an old blind man, a black man, a midget, a gay couple, and an Oriental, who's dopey but knockout running-gag is that he speaks in English words. while the original tribe continues to labor under the thumb of a bullying leader, the misfit tribe makes the sort of progressive discoveries - fire, music, weapons - it takes a brain to understand and appreciate. the basic story is the moment when it is discovered that intelligence has as much value as brawn. Ringo, you see, is the original genius, and under his leadership they manage to displace the tyrannical brutes who formerly held control.so the central theme is how it is those outside the proverbial box who effect progress. whether this is the moral of the story or simply an observation is for any given viewer to surmise. (after all, not everyone wants to have their thoughts provoked by a slapstick comedy.)the other major theme, a surprisingly sophisticated one for a film where only one person (a minor character at that) speaks coherent English, is the discovery that the object of one's crush is unworthy of it. Ringo can only fight back the realization for so long. (although he did marry her anyway, didn't he?)on the whole this is a film that aims for, and achieves, the broadest possible brand of ""low"" comedy. the signature moment, after all, is John Matusak forgetting to let go of a boulder before he throws it, and subsequently going down with it. this a movie where the dinosaurs are stop-motion work by whoever is the poor man's Ray Harryhausen...and they had to be, because realistic JURASSIC PARK style dinosaurs would've counteracted the overall goofy tone. but who says a film can do things like that or have things to say, but not both?",1.0,0,53,8,111,5,0,3421,584,1,0.06695226070226072,-0.07202380952380949,58.11,63.36,0.04455966493358948,0.001590513802947302,0.001610339690012681,0.45988782166480807,0.4923516599086424,0.015492546039169833,0.0002922267679719462,1,,0.0,0.75,0.0,,long,

The International is such a film.  This film about an enormous bank involved in all sort of international conspiracies is beautifully filmed all over the world: New York, Milan, Paris, Turkey, etc.  The architecture where each scene was filmed was carefully chosen.  There is a exciting shootout that takes place in the Guggenheim museum in New York.  As a New Yorker, I was quite interested in how the Guggenheim would let them film such an action packed sequence with so many hundreds of rounds of ammunition being fired.  As I learned in one of the documentaries after the film, they built an exact replica of the inside of the Guggenheim inside an abandoned factory that used to build locomotives.  The set was built in 6 weeks while the real Guggenheim took 4 years to build.  All this work for a film that was neither a critical nor box office success.Clive Owen is scruffy, unshaven, rumpled and generally filthy looking the entire film as the obsessed Interpol agent looking to bring this bank down.

Or does he really appears to be who everyone thinks that they know?Sommersby is about unconditional love, and it is about a man that brings joy and renewal into the lives for others.  I certainly never forget Sommersby!",1.0,0,50,10,32,2,1,1141,208,1,0.1717288961038961,1.0,73.27,95.17,0.0032890551872249854,0.0033293609811549485,0.1833879196353553,0.5852259258980066,0.2247677382982583,0.04382120946538125,0.0008756567425569177,1,,0.0,0.8888888888888888,0.0,5.0,long,

Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of ""holes"" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and ""Attack of the Clones"" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the ""Ultimate Enhanced Version"" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch ""Serenity"" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of ""Mannequin"" to ""Annakin"" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story.",0.4,6,33,8,99,0,1,3409,599,1,0.16415125278761641,0.0,68.1,114.12,0.04167349765945542,0.0010909607369373288,0.6299648869291925,0.0010938640054835363,0.32617679066893124,0.009680258140217073,0.00011730205278592375,1,,0.0,0.36363636363636365,2.4000000000000004,4.0,long,

I've always kind of enjoyed it, even with it's storyline glitches, and believe me I am very picky about WWII movies.  OK, totally believable it's not, but  if you're looking for an exciting adventure movie this might be your thing.  It is interesting to note that this is one of the earlier movies to  portray the hotbed of Balkan politics that we all know today.  I first saw  this film when I was still young and in school and it inspired me to read  up on the Balkans, it's Partisans, Chetniks, Croats, and Serbs.  Strange as  it sounds, I actually had a better understanding of Balkan politics when  Yugoslavia splintered in the early 90's thanks in small part to this film.
